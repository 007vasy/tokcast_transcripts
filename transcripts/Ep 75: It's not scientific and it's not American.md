### 0m

Welcome to TalkCast audio only listeners. This is not a standard episode. It's an episode already released on YouTube but without this preamble which is here to tell you two things. Firstly that this episode is me reading a Scientific American article and part of an article from the journal Nature. Now that may sound boring but as it turns out this episode has generated quite a bit more interest than my usual ones for reasons that will become apparent as you listen through it. Whatever the case as I am reading the article if you're merely listening it might get confusing precisely because on the YouTube version I have the article up there for you to read along to and because I did this episode in more of a hurry than my usual more prepared episodes the reading is sometimes a bit faster than I should have done and even somewhat muted in places. So that's the first thing. If it gets annoying hearing me read these articles without the visual cues you might prefer YouTube. The other reason this preamble is here is just to say for whatever reason some people, not many,

### 1m

just a minority, don't like all of what I say. Which to me is a little strange because I am essentially arguing a few things that I think are reasonably uncontroversial. The first of which is that I don't think it's the business of science magazines let alone science journals to take strongly political and economic positions on things. I think it is to the detriment of not merely their reputation and good standing but also their position on things. So I think it's a real shame to alright this and I think it's a real shame to be so good at writing the most recent article. To show that I don't really like all of the stuff I say and what I'm writing but to their ability to be objective on matters where there is a dispute. This brings into question their stance on matters scientifc. The problems with peer review and journals and scientific communication already run deep. Some of these issues include poor communication, confused explanations, bias, and worse will that problem become? But the main reason people object to my remarks here seems to be that I express concerns about the opinions expressed by the writers of these articles. Those

### 2m

writers are ostensibly scientists. As I will say early on, economics is just as much a domain of expertise as any area of science. But it is not science, it's economics, which means human creativity, human decision-making, has a strong effect on the outcomes in that field. This is less like, say, physics or chemistry, where people's choices will not change the fact that if you add an acid to a base, you will get a salt and water. Or, if you drop a large metal sphere near the surface of the earth, it will accelerate towards the earth at 9.8 meters per second per second. These things, governed by laws of nature, are largely independent of what people choose to do. But economics, like science, is not. Economics, like psychology, is a domain where the very outcome depends upon the choices people make. It's unpredictable inherently. The outcome does depend on what people choose to do. What people choose to do is the whole game in town. And because of this, in both domains, I argue that

### 3m

people be free to be creative. So in matters psychological, mental health, so to speak, of the individuals is maximized when people are not being coerced. In economics, and this is the point, people are free to choose solutions or create new solutions themselves. That is optimism. The idea that people can indeed solve problems, and the more people that are free to solve their problems, the more they will freely cooperate and prepare for the unknown by creating more knowledge. The problems we know about now are but a tiny sliver of what is yet to come, the infinite unknown. And the only way to prepare, for the infinite unknown, is to create knowledge now and generate wealth now to help ensure we do not go the way of every other civilization that has ever been, but now is not. All those extinct civilizations did the same thing. Ultimately, they fell into stasis. They could not solve a

### 4m

problem that they were confronted with. One modern incarnation of the term stasis is sustainable. Now, they're not precisely identical. And in a few previous episodes, see episodes 51, 52, 54, and 56, for more on this, all the episodes titled Unsustainable in various parts, I explain the deep dichotomy, even a kind of paradox, at the heart of that term, sustainable. It means conflicting things. There is confusion over the term as I try to elucidate. If you have the book, The Beginning of Infinity, I refer you to page 441, where David tells us the meaning of sustain, and I'll quote, quote, sustain. The term has almost two opposite, but often confused meanings. To provide someone with what they need, and to prevent things from changing, end quote. And I think that's quite right. Whatever the case, as will become apparent, the articles I refer to

### 5m

are very keen on sustainability without properly explaining what they mean by it. As I get towards the end of the articles, I explain what I think are some of the motivations for so-called environmentalism, what these motivations are from a philosophical and political perspective. These stand in contrast to the vision of our situation presented in optimistic circles, such as outlined in The Beginning of Infinity. But all of that is quite unpopular, I realize. The zeitgeist right now is doom and gloom, and that calls for doomy and gloomy political movements, and, as worse, economic prescriptions. You may not agree with what I say herein, but I'll just appeal to your willingness to hear the other side if you don't. If you already do, then enjoy me going off about what I think is a bad, and, in turn, for scientists and scientific journals demonstrating their ignorance on matters economic and optimistic, and epistemology, and resources. All right, on to the episode.

### 6m

Hello, welcome to TalkCast. This is not a new look for me. I'm just doing a very quick piece to camera, I suppose, a little vlog about an article that was in the Scientific American a couple of days ago. I've only just read it. I just thought I'd respond off the cuff rather than preparing anything lengthy about it. So let's just read through it and see what we think. OK, so here's the article. It's by a couple of people down here, written June 20th, 2021, and it's called The Delusion of Infinite Economic Growth. So, delusion. That automatically implies some kind of psychological disorder. So, they're presuming that this is not, the idea of infinite economic growth, is not something that might be argued for from a scientific standpoint, or from an economic standpoint, or any kind of objective standpoint, but rather it's some kind of mental malady.

### 7m

So, here's our first problem. Now, who are the two people that are writing this? Now, we can't judge people based upon their backgrounds, but these two people happen to be physicists, and we can go to the end of the article to find out that one of them happens to be a climate physicist, and works in meteorology, and another one is a professor of physics working on transdisciplinary climate pedagogy. So, I guess that means something to the effect of teaching climate science. Okay. So, anyway, whatever the case, they're both physicists. Now, the thing is that there is such a thing as expertise, and no doubt these two people are experts in physics. How does that qualify them to be experts in economics or financial matters?

### 8m

Now, I'm not an expert, and do not pretend to be an expert in economics or in financial matters, but I do recognize that there is such a thing as expertise in this. And so, I've taken time to read economists like Thomas Sowell, to listen to financial experts like Jeroen Broek, and various other people. And so, I've learned over time that people are pining off the cuff about economic matters seem just as silly sometimes as people who have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever of physics, but send prominent physicists. Their ideas for how to improve upon Einstein, even though their background might be civil engineering, or no science at all, but they think that they can disprove Einstein. Many physicists know this feeling. This is the sense that I got as I read this article.

### 9m

It read to me like cranks. It read to me kind of like people who know absolutely nothing whatsoever about economics or the arguments for infinite economic growth. And I know that the arguments for infinite... Infinite economic growth are not made very often. There's very few of us who do make this. Even people who are against strange socialist Marxist tribal ideas, ancient tribal ideas, even those ostensibly on our side in the battle of ideas, don't think that something like literally infinite growth is possible. That growth can just continue off into the infinite future. Okay, but let's just read through, okay? Okay, I won't spend too... I won't spend too long ranting on this, but I just thought it would be informative to read through it paragraph by paragraph and see where the errors are. The philosophical errors, the epistemological errors. So they begin. Even sustainable technologies such as electric vehicles and wind turbines face unbreachable physical limits and exact grave environmental costs.

### 10m

Well, of course they're going, yes. So immediately, yes, of course there's going to be physical limits on technologies. Grave environmental costs. Well, there's a grave environmental costs for not embracing the latest technologies. We need to have technology in order to protect ourselves from the environment, a point I've made over and over again. There is pollution out there that is forever trying to get into our waterways. The natural world is just a polluted sphere of germs and viruses. And chemicals that are not good for us. And so that's why we need filtration. That's why we need antiseptics. That's why we need antivirals and vaccines. These things constitute pollutants in the environment that are dangerous for living organisms.

### 11m

And especially for us. And it is interesting, of course, we can immediately see here that even the environmentalists are warring amongst themselves. So, you know, no true Scotsman this is. You know, that they're having a go at people on their own. So, if you think that you're doing good by embracing electric vehicles and you think you're doing good by embracing green energy, we're not good enough. You're not good enough. Well, how can you be better? How can you be more pure? The electric vehicle, EV, has become one of the great modern symbols of a world awakened to the profound challenges of unsustainability and climate change. So much so that we may well imagine that deep thoughts answer today to life, the universe and everything might plausibly be EV. But as Douglas Adams. Would surely have asked if electric vehicles are the answer. What is the question? OK, I'm kind of I'm kind of thinking at this point that, you know, maybe it's this article is written by the fossil fuel industry. Who knows? Let's keep going. Let us imagine the perfect EV, solar powered, efficient, reliable and affordable.

### 12m

But is it sustainable? EVs powered by renewable energy may help reduce the carbon footprint of transport. Yet the measure of sustainability is not merely the carbon footprint, but the material footprint. The aggregate quantity of biomass metal ores. Construction. Minerals and fossil fuels used during production and consumption of a product. The approximate metric ton weight of an electric vehicle constitutes materials such as metals, including rare earths, plastics, glass and rubber. Therefore, a global spike in the demand for EVs would drive an increased demand for each of these minerals. End quote. Of course. Of course. And isn't that a wonderful thing? Isn't it wonderful that we have the knowledge to turn those otherwise completely useless resources, metal ores, biomass. Oil into this amazing thing, this vehicle powered by electricity that can accelerate faster than, you know, usually combustion vehicles of the same kind. The idea of sustainable, they mention sustainable, they're going to keep mentioning sustainable.

### 13m

Let's just recall this idea of sustainability as explained in the beginning of infinity. Now, sustainable means in one sense to keep things the same. To ensure that change doesn't happen over time. You just sustain something so it's the same day after day after day. And if you can't do that, then of course if the thing doesn't remain the same day after day after day, then it's not sustainable. But we people cannot possibly remain the same day after day after day. We want to make progress. We want to solve our problems. The world is not going to remain the same. The world is not sustainable. So, the other meaning of sustainable is, of course, to provide what something needs, to sustain it, to keep it going. What we need, what we humans need is constant change. So, this is why there's this weird paradox within the meaning of the word there.

### 14m

On the one hand, keep things the same the day after day after day. But the very thing that we need is not to keep things the same day after day after day. And indeed, we need to keep things the same the day after day after day. And indeed, not every other animal, by the way, can't remain the same day after day after day because the environment changes. The environment necessarily changes. The universe is in flux. It's changing all the time. Eventually, the asteroid will be coming or the equivalent of an asteroid, a virus or something else, something unknown at the moment. And that situation won't be sustainable. But I think these people, these pessimistic, anti-technology people, who are against the use, let's just say exploitation of resources, they are for the extinction of people. They think people are bad. They think people are destroying the planet. And nothing is further from the truth. We're trying to actually keep the planet going so it's worth living in.

### 15m

Because the planet is not caring. If it had a will at all, if you were to ascribe a will to the planet, it's trying to... destroy itself and to destroy all of the other species on it. After all, it's cooling down. It's invariably cooling down. The centre of the Earth is cooling down. It's becoming geologically less active over time. And meanwhile, the sun is getting hotter. So it's becoming more and more hostile over time to the life that exists here right now, as it always has. It has periodically just caused the extinction of massive species over and over again. The planet, the planet is not a friendly place. We have to make it. We have to eke out our existence. OK, let's keep going. Every stage of the life cycle of any manufactured product exacts environmental costs. Habitat destruction, biodiversity loss and pollution, including carbon emissions from the extraction of war on materials, manufacturing, construction through to disposal. Thus, it is the increasing global material footprint that is fundamentally the reason for the twin climate ecological crises.

### 16m

OK, so, pausing there. There's not a climate or ecological crisis. Neither of those things are true. If anything... If anything, both the climate and ecology is in a better position than it has been throughout the geological history of the Earth. Precisely because people are here solving the problems for it. There are just so many people on this planet now concerned about the climate. But they are doing everything they can in order to sustain the climate at present levels. As if, as if that's a good thing. Knowing full well that the climate has changed over time via natural processes. Now that we are here, however... We should want to keep the climate in a state that is suitable for us. And off into the infinite future, we should hope to have a climate that is rather like our own climate inside of our houses. I've got climate control inside of my house. I can turn the temperature down when I want and turn the temperature up when I want.

### 17m

Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could do that locally in certain places? Turn the temperature up where we want to have crops growing more efficiently and turn the temperature down... ...in places where we'd like to go snow skiing, for example. Wouldn't that be wonderful? That's the kind of climate I would like to sustain and to control. As for ecological crises, when hasn't there been this ecological crisis? People are solving these things. All of those things, biodiversity loss. How much biodiversity loss would there be without people trying to create the knowledge in order to save these animals and plants? All of these... ...so-called problems, by the way, are simply the result of enacting solutions to far worse problems. Far worse problems. Insofar as you think that carbon emissions are a problem. The problem that existed prior to any kind of carbon emissions from a man-made factory, car, coal-fired power station, etc., etc.

### 18m

That problem was the problem of surviving. ...of surviving. Surviving without electricity, the comforts of a fossil fuel industry that provide housing and clothing and all of that stuff. The problem of not being able to get from here to there fast enough. The problem of not being able to cook your food efficiently. The problem of not being able to feed all the people on the planet. So we solve those problems, more or less. We're 99% of the way there. It used to be the case that, you know, whatever. I don't know. 90%? 90% of people were starving. Then it went to 50%. Then it went to 30%. And now we've got about, I think, at most, we could find 1% of people on this planet starving, if that. I think I'm being generous there. But along with solving these problems, these really important problems, the problem of transportation, the problem of food, the problem of housing, the problem of clothing, all of which is solved by fossil fuel industry.

### 19m

Solved by burning certain fossil fuels, of burning oil, of burning coal, of creating things out of that. Yes, we create some other problems, which are better problems. We've got a little bit of pollution to deal with, perhaps. I don't like breathing in grimy air. So we've got that problem. Let's try and get that grime, those nasty nitrous oxides and sulfur dioxides out of the air. Great. Make the air look nice and clean. Take the carbon dioxide out, too, if you want. Plant more trees. Get some more carbon-eating bacteria. Do some carbon sequestration. If you want to do that. Great. That is a minor problem in the scheme of things, in the great scheme of things. We keep being told that the great catastrophe is coming. The great catastrophe has already been avoided to a large extent. The great catastrophe of the past, of people literally starving to death and freezing to death because there wasn't enough food.

### 20m

There wasn't enough shelter. There wasn't enough clothing. There wasn't enough wealth to change. There wasn't enough food to change their situation. Okay, let's keep on going. And they write, The global material footprint has grown in lockstep with the exponentially rising global economy since the Industrial Revolution. Okay, so that's a good thing. I don't know if they think it's a good thing, but isn't it wonderful that the global economy has risen exponentially? This is largely because of egregious consumption by the super affluent in a socioeconomic system founded on growth without limits. Well, here we go. We're getting a tell here. Automatically, they're having a go at the rich. That's who they come for. Coming for the rich. The socioeconomic system. So they want to get rid of the socioeconomic system. What? Capitalism, of course. What do they want instead? They want communism. Okay, they might not say it out loud. It's a dirty word. That's what they want.

### 21m

That's what they're going to be arguing for. They go on to say, Can we resolve this fundamental conflict between the quest for limitless growth and the consequential... environmental destruction? Okay. The environment is the universe. Okay, let's just get that straight. The environment is not merely the forest in the Amazon, which is what people think of, or the oceans, or the air. The environment is the universe. It is limitless. Okay, as far as the cosmologists know and the astrophysicists know, it's limitless. There's no bound to it. And we can just keep spreading out. And insofar as it's not limitless, it's effectively so. People, a trillion years hence, might have to... worry about some of the absolute limits of what physics tells us that the universe is going to be like once it expands to a certain size. We don't need to worry about it right now. Let them. They'll create the knowledge of what to do then. But for now, we have the ability to create limitless growth. And one reason is because we have limitless resources.

### 22m

Why? Because a resource isn't a resource until you have the knowledge of how to exploit it. Lots of examples of this exist. The one that I've used before is pitchblende. Pitchblende is the name of a rock. It's an ore that exists in various places around the world, in particular in the northern territory of Australia. For millennia, that rock sat in the ground completely inert, doing nothing for anybody ever. Then, physicists of the 20th century figured out atomic physics, nuclear physics. They figured out... that uranium could be used in order to generate heat inside of nuclear reactors. And so they created nuclear reactors which used exploited uranium. Where do you find uranium? In pitchblende, among other places. Cool. Now, that pitchblende, which was hitherto useless, it wasn't a resource previously. It wasn't a resource because no one knew how to use it.

### 23m

Only after... Only after nuclear physics were we able to exploit that. Were we able to extract the uranium... out of that ore, and then actually turn it into something useful. A resource is only a resource in the context of knowledge, which allows you to know that it's a resource. How many other bits of the earth, otherwise useless at the moment, will become resources in the future because some smart person figures out how to use it? Much less the rest of the solar system, and galaxy, and universe. Substances out there. That... That if we can put... If we can properly exploit them, make the world better for millions, billions, and eventually trillions more people. This is what we should want. This is what we should want to do. Of course, in the future, what we'll have is this thing called the Universal Constructor, which will be able to take any atoms at all that you like, as long as you've got the elements there, and just rearrange them into whatever product you want.

### 24m

Okay? Perhaps an interstellar spaceship. Let's keep going. Enter technology. Technological innovation and efficiency improvements are often cited as pathways to decouple growth in material use from economic growth. While technology undoubtedly has a crucial role to play in the transition to a sustainable world, it is constrained by fundamental physical principles and pragmatic economic considerations. Okay, what do they mean by a transition to a sustainable world? A world that remains the same year after year after year? I don't think they think it through. I don't think anyone really thinks this through that talks about sustainability. The world is not going to sit there for you, remaining the same over time. That's not sustainable. It's not sustainable for us. As I say, not only is the asteroid coming eventually, and we better want to have the knowledge in time to deflect it. We probably already do. Although some people keep on arguing against rich people like Elon Musk having the technology, having the wealth to actually be able to do that.

### 25m

Okay? Having the wealth to actually be able to do something like deflect an asteroid if it was on a collision course with the Earth. But forget asteroids. We just got through an 18-month long pandemic, which really was a minor pandemic. Could you imagine if something was far worse than COVID-19, far more contagious, far more deadly? Would we have the wealth and the knowledge to be able to deal with that crisis? We've already spent so much wealth already on a relatively minor crisis. So imagine a worse virus. Imagine something that's not a virus. Something that attacks the human body that we hitherto had no knowledge of whatsoever. You know, these things have arisen. Prions are one, you know, over the years. Who knows what might appear in the future? Or the equivalent of an asteroid. What if it wasn't an asteroid? What if it was a stray planet? Astronomers have talked about this, that the stray planets might actually outnumber the planets that orbit around stars for various reasons.

### 26m

Or just other things that go flying through the cosmos. Or just the unknown. How do we prepare for the unknown? We have to create knowledge faster. How do we create knowledge faster? By investing in research. This isn't just research funded by the government. It's funded by private enterprise creating new technologies. How can they do this as fast as possible? Having cheap energy, cheap fuel in order to power the computers of the future. Wealth so that people have the time to be creative. Wealth so that we can automate almost everything that hitherto isn't automated aside from the creative output of people's brains. People assembling things in factories should be thinking creatively. They should be doing something else. Everyone driving a vehicle for a job should be free instead to be able to do something creative. And I think they all can. Forget about what the pessimists say out there. People who think that not everyone can be creative. Not everyone can be intelligent.

### 27m

Not everyone can be rubbish. Everyone can and would love to be. Would absolutely love to be. Do you think a truck driver would not prefer to be doing something else? They would. Do you think that someone who's assembling something on an assembly line in a factory wouldn't prefer to be doing something creative, artistic, intellectual? They would. It is a strange ivory tower, disconnected way of viewing people. I don't know if these people don't actually ever talk to people who are involved in these jobs. Who talk to checkout cashiers. Who talk to people in mundane jobs that could be automated. They don't want to be doing those things. They'd rather be doing something else. In an extremely wealthy future they will. A future where they're allowed to exploit their creativity. A future where their creativity can help solve their own problems in their own life. And the problems for the rest of us as well. About how to exploit resources. About how to expand out beyond this planet. Because we have to. It's not sustainable living on this planet. It's not sustainable at all. Not only for us. For the rest of the animals and plants that you might care about.

### 28m

If you care about panda bears, then perhaps in the future we can move the panda bears somewhere else where it is sustainable. To another planet. This is off into the distant future, obviously. But we know it's not sustainable to remain here. Scientifically it's not sustainable. If we keep things the same here, the sun will heat up. It will expand. It will engulf the earth. That will be the end of us. We know that's coming. And that is just one thing that we know about happening. We can almost guarantee. There will be something unknown. Something we cannot predict. That will come from the clear blue sky. We need to have a stance of knowledge production and creation. We need to be able to exploit the resources as fast as possible. The only thing that's sustainable. The only thing that's sustainable is creating knowledge faster and faster. Which requires energy. You need energy to power knowledge production. Let's keep on going. Examples abound. The energy efficiency of airplanes has improved little for decades since they have been operating close to the theoretical peak efficiency.

### 29m

Likewise, there's a hard limit on the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. About 35% because the physical properties of semiconductors that constitute them. In practice, few exceed 20% for economic and pragmatic reasons. The power generation of large wind farms is limited to about 1 watt per square meter as a simple yet unavoidable physical consequence of wake effects. The awesome exponential increase in computing power over the past five decades. Will end by about 2025. Since it is physically impossible to take transistors on a computer chip or a roughly 5% of the size of coronavirus. Much smaller. Okay. Few errors in here. Okay. Well, firstly, yes. Absolutely. This is an interesting thing about thermodynamics, by the way. People might think, you know, I was recently considering, you know, combustion engines. This is something that you learn about when you do a physics degree. Whatever the case. The interesting thing is you can't make a combustion engine out of it. You can't make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. You can make it out of it. Whatever the case, the interesting thing is you can't make a combustion engine. You can't make any engine perfectly 100% efficient. Indeed. Indeed.

### 30m

The best that you can hope for, as they say there, for combustion engines.. Yeah. Well, I think it's about 40%, something like that, and this is thermodynamics. Okay. So, yes, but what's the big deal? What's the concern here? is somehow got it in for us that because you're not allowed to have a more efficient device thermodynamics puts a hard limit on these things that somehow or other this is a reason to perhaps stop building so many engines as for this thing about um the end of moore's law well yeah you can't put more transistors on a computer than once the transistors get down to you know the size of atom literally once you've got transistors the size of an atom you've got a problem if you're going to go through classical computation unless of course you increase the number of processors okay moore's law hasn't been deviated from that much if you just consider

### 31m

the overall power of the computer perhaps if you just consider the speed of the processor that's all a moot point we have a theory of quantum computation we already have an avenue to we have a vision for computers that are vastly more powerful than any computer that exists now so this pessimism is undermined by david deutsch's proof of the theoretical possibility of practically building quantum computers okay we just have to get through the engineering difficulties of course if these people will have their way then um powering the research of the future perhaps quantum computers might be very energy intensive goodness knows what will happen then we'll have people protesting about the building of quantum computers the very thing that might solve the problems of the future might be protested about the building of quantum computers the very thing that might solve the problems of the future might be protested away because people are more concerned that everyone has exactly the same access to all the resources in the world let's keep going whether it is principles of classical quantum or solid state physics or thermodynamics each place is different but inexorable constraints on technological solutions no it doesn't no it

### 32m

doesn't i mean yes there are things that are physically possible and things that are physically impossible you can't make physically impossible technology big deal big deal that has no bearing whatsoever on our ability to solve problems and make progress off into the infinite future you can't build a rocket that goes faster than the speed of light but does that mean you can't get anywhere in the galaxy no in your rest frame okay you if you travel close to the speed of light you can get almost anywhere instantly of course everyone else will see you take you know hundreds of thousands of years to get from here to there that's relativity point is it doesn't really place inexorable constraints on technology it doesn't really place constraints on technological solutions a solution is only a solution if it's physically possible so forget that let's keep going basically physical principles that have allowed incredible technological leaps over the past century also inevitably limit them we might consider that extensive recycling

### 33m

of materials would offset efficiency limits recycling is crucial no it's not however while glass and metals can be recycled almost indefinitely without loss of quality materials such as paper and plastic can be recycled only a few more times before it becomes too degraded okay just on this point about recycling recycling people people are overly concerned about waste weight the the idea more waste it's a sign of a healthy society now we don't want to be living in a polluted city we want the waste a long way away from us buried in the ground or otherwise available for recycling it won't be far into the future all of this will become what hope okay so long as these people don't get their way what hope okay so long as these people don't get their way a century from now once again if we have universal 3d printers okay universal constructors of a kind then they will be able to assemble technology of any kind that you can come up with a program for the object to make

### 34m

including other universal constructors so the universal constructor will be something like a 3d printer that will be able to build any device that you like so long as you've got a program for it you can program the computer to get the universal constructor to build the device okay universal constructor presumably is some kind of robot which is assembling things on a microscopic scale nanoscale perhaps atom by atom it can assemble something like a computer or a quantum computer or a car or a rocket whatever now when that thing comes to the end of its natural life because physics causes things to degrade unless of course you have universal constructors within those things constantly repairing them so they never actually need to be thrown away but let's say they didn't need to be thrown away then the universal constructor could be a universal destructor and just change all of that stuff back into the fundamental elements out of which it was made in the first place and presumably these universal constructors of the future which are physically possible which will happen at some point perhaps you don't even need a universal

such thing then we could use these things in our rubbish tips our garbage dumps uh that we have today that would otherwise be causing pollution of groundwater or something whatever your environmental concern you have and change them back into harmless materials that aren't pollutants this can all be fixed with technology the future there are some problems now they need solutions the solution is not let's complain about technology and slow down the rate of progress that is not the lesson here let's keep going additionally recycling itself may be an energy and materials intensive process even if physical laws could be broken they cannot to achieve recycling with 100 efficient efficiency added demand from the imperative for economic growth would necessarily require virgin materials the key point is that efficiency is limited by physics but there is no sufficiency limit on the so on the socio-economic construct of demand okay maybe these people are actually on my side you know arguing against recycling i don't have anything against recycling if people

### 36m

want to do recycling and make money out of recycling that's great my concern is that quite often higher quality and cheaper products can be made from raw materials without having to worry about recycling them let's keep going unfortunately the situation is even more dire economic growth is required to be exponential that is the size of the economy must double in a fixed period as referenced earlier this has driven a corresponding increase in the material footprint to understand the nature of exponential growth consider the ev suppose that we have enough easily extractable lithium for the batteries needed to fuel the ev revolution for another 30 years now assume that deep sea mining provides four times the current amount of these minerals materials are we covered for 120 years no because they're not going to be covered for 120 years no because the current 10 growth rate in demand for lithium is equivalent to doubling demand every seven years which means we would only have enough for 44 years in effect we could we would cause untold perhaps irreversible devastation of marine ecosystems to buy ourselves a few extra years supply of raw materials okay this is nothing but malthus's error applied to lithium that's all that

### 37m

is you know these people who've argued for centuries that for example it is clear and we can that we've got the power we can do whatever we need to do for the longer term outcomes in our hands malthus really says we have to invest in nuclear power we can't have production in the land never in a day we're gonna be able to grow that land have a much better future in particular we can do vertical farming as just one solution now in this case electric vehicles lithium we don't know if we can't make more and more efficient electric vehicles via different processes that these people haven't thought of before or that lithium can't be found in various

### 38m

places that we didn't know of before we're not going to run out of lithium anytime soon and even if we did there's no physical theory that can put a barrier on us producing batteries that are even better than the lithium ones we have today made of different materials who knows what these people don't i don't point is you can't prophesy you cannot predict the content of future knowledge but this is this is what sustainability is it's a fixed mindset it's thinking that the technology available today is the only technology that's ever going to be available the knowledge available today is the only knowledge that's ever going to be available it's a very parochial way of thinking that the last 10 years of your personal career your expert personal career which includes the technology that's available today is the only technology that's ever going to be available today is the only technology that's ever going to be available today is the only technology includes reading articles from the scientific american is the entire corpus of human knowledge that's where it started and that's where it finished as if there was no history of progress before that and there'll be no history of progress after this as well of course problems will continue to be solved okay let's keep going exponential growth swiftly inevitably swamps

anything in finite supply for a virus that finite resources the human population in the context of the planet it is its physical resource okay again mouthless again nothing but mouthless okay but the idea of finite supply finite supply if only nothing about our knowledge changes about how to use that particular resource how long will the coal last on planet earth we've had predictions for decades now about how it's going to run out at some point in the future but the thing is the amount that we're using seems to be although in some senses increasing in other senses decreasing because people are transitioning away from it so won't the coal last possibly forever if we all transition away from it so we're going to have to think about how we're going to use that particular resource so how was that a prediction in the first place that was going to run out at some point in the future same is true for oil same is true for every single resource we tend to move from one resource to another not necessarily because some scientist comes along and says it's going to run out but because we find something better something more efficient to use in the case of coal a lot of

### 40m

people are now using natural gas we don't need to get into the debates about it but the point is that people find other resources a good reason to change from one resource to another is because it's more efficient and cheaper to use that other resource but right now the marxist communist collectivist socialists of the world want us to artificially move from one to another why not because that other resource is better because they want to slow down progress they want to impose regulations on people why because they're fixated on control and one way of being fixated on control is through the lens through the the the the mechanism of environmentalism environmentalism is a great way of being able to say the is coming we need control right now you all need to do what you're told otherwise the world is going to end move from this resource to that resource they remain in charge telling you that they're looking after your best interests they're not they're putting artificial dampeners on growth and wealth creation let's keep going the inescapable inference is that it is essentially

more and more people okay i'm skipping a paragraph and then they say what is sustainability these observations lead us to a natural minimum condition for sustainability all resource use curves must be simultaneously flatlined and all pollution curves simultaneously extinguished it is this resource perspective that allows us to see why evs may help offset carbon emissions yet remain utterly unsustainable under the limitless growth growth paradigm okay well that whatever that's nonsense i don't understand what this that's not an answer to what sustainability is this idea that all pollution curves must be simultaneously extinct we have to get rid of all pollution well i thought these people were physicists okay this this is a almost a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics no process can be perfectly efficient there's going to be waste even in the form of heat is heat not a form of pollution are we artificially heating the planet is that what isn't that what they're concerned about so we need you existing causes um pollution as for all resource curves must be simultaneously

### 44m

flatlined no no you try and use only the same amount of resources over time then that means that you're not improving you're literally flatlining you're not creating anything new which includes knowledge by the way okay you're going to just have this we can't remain in stasis stasis means you're going to go backwards because you're going to encounter a problem that you haven't encountered before and you won't be able to solve it because you won't have enough wealth technology or knowledge in order to do so the only way to prepare for the unknown future is to continually rapidly create more knowledge and that's the only way to do it and that's the requires more technology and that requires more wealth and that requires the use of more resources and that requires more energy this is not some crazy theory this is simple logic it's simple logic the knowledge economy is fueled by fuel by energy first law of thermodynamics first

### 45m

law of thermodynamics can't get out more energy than what we put in okay let's keep going the real question this is titled we have argued that the inexorable link between material consumption and gdp makes the infinite growth of the world and the infinite growth of the world paradigm incompatible with sustaining ecological integrity forget the science and the arguments the english is just terrible okay thus while evs constitute a partial answer to the climate question within the current paradigm that will only exacerbate the larger anthropocentric crises connected to unsustainable resource consumption it's not unsustainable the only thing that's unsustainable is not consuming resources to reduce the consumption of resources that's unsustainable that really is unsustainable that means that human civilization will go backwards that means we'll be unable to deal with the problems of tomorrow we won't have the technology we won't have the power the wealth in order to solve the problems of tomorrow the infinite growth paradigm is just okay let's put it into more simple terms the infinite growth

### 46m

paradigm simply means unbounded progress that's what that means we just need to keep on solving the problems of the future and in order to do that we have to keep on growing it's the only option if we are to shrink in number as people the number of creative entities that exist on this planet will decrease the number of solutions therefore that we're going to be able to produce because each person only has a finite amount of creative output that they can have that they can produce is going to reduce in lockstep with that we need to increase the population we need to increase the amount of resources that we're using we need to increase the amount of energy that we're using overall we can be more efficient but we need to increase the amount of energy that we're using overall we need to increase the amount of energy that we're using but we want to spread out from this planet as i keep on saying now this might not need to happen for millennia hence but if people succeed at this argument now there will be no people millennia hence we will have gone extinct if i seem passionate it's because this is the argument

of our age if these people win because they've come close before don't mistake it these people came close in the second world war to winning the argument these people have come close again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again it's all the same it's tribal collective tyrannical okay the ancient tribes that wandered the african wilderness tribal replaced by a feudal system a collective idea where there was one person at the top and everyone else was more or less equal beneath them okay we had some barons we had some ranks but the overwhelming majority of people were serfs and then we had the idea of codifying this kind of idea in marxist ideas okay where where we needed a central committee we need some sort of central committee that is in charge and then everyone else is completely equal these are all basically logically equivalent a couple of people at the top and everyone the chiefs the kings or the commissars and everyone else equal beneath them we we can't go back to this this has been the to the ruination of

### 48m

civilizations prior to this one it's a shame that many of us have to devote our intellectual efforts to defending a thesis which is so obviously correct against some that is so obviously false wars have been fought and won for civilization for progress for peace prosperity wealth and technological improvement that's in part what the second world war was about among other things among other things those people we were fighting against wanted stasis these people want stasis they don't call it status they call it sustainability now but it's the same idea they want things to remain the same they want everyone to be the same to be equal forced equality okay let's keep going we'll go past their graphs their malthusian graphs okay unsustainable

### 49m

resource use going up there why well why can't we just keep doing we're not staying on planet earth okay and by the way the amount of planet earth that currently we occupy is such a tiny fraction of a percentage get in an airplane sometime and have a look out the window and you'll see that cities are tiny specks on this the face of this planet so much of it is just uninhabited and unused by the way there's so many resources yet to be used pollution over time oh that's scary isn't it yeah um resource use that's sustainable pollution decreasing to zero well look no one complains about pollution going down sure let's have the pollution going down no problem but of course once we get rid of one kind of pollution there'll be another kind of pollution that people complain about you know the in the industrial revolution the air quality was so much worse in london than what it is today and yet we're producing more than ever so we've we've gone from one kind of pollution to another kind of pollution the invisible sort of pollution isn't that better okay and maybe we'll get rid of that as well and then we'll have a different kind of pollution

### 50m

people won't stop complaining of course whatever the next kind of pollution is they'll they'll keep on complaining about it oh i've come to the end of the article but i need to go back there's just this one we we forgot to click on the link to the link to the link to the link to the link to the link on this the real question is how do we transition to alternative economic paradigm so that that that's really what we're getting at here this scientific american the scientists from the scientific american which i would say is not scientific none of this has been scientific none of it it's all been an economic appeal for stasis for not solving problems for going backwards and in fact attacking their own kind attacking other environmentalists for not being pure enough in some way that we're the but none of this is good enough that's basically what we're saying here isn't it what we're saying is that your electric vehicles and your recycling and all that great environmental stuff that you do that's not enough you know what you need let's click here what you need is to be against affluence that's what you need scientists warning on affluence we

### 51m

need to be against rich people we've heard that before haven't we they're often the first to go we know who comes next we know who is also in that group but let's not hide it okay they're coming for affluence they're coming for wealth they're coming for rich people these are these are the people that have always started the wars these are the people that have demanded that that that things be confiscated from those who have they don't understand economics these people are utterly economic illiterate okay the previous article from the scientific american it just reeks with complete ignorance of of of any aspect of how the economy might run of how progress works i want to say to them keep your beak out of other people's business it's like people who argue about well there was this there was it was like this very recently this complaint i think was it on the

### 52m

bbc or something this whole thing about amazon produces too much waste i think it was in america actually the amazon amazon the company the corporation destroys too many products as people chiming in saying this is terrible this is off what's it got to do with anyone it's amazon's property they can do with it what they like it's logically equivalent to the grocery store your local grocery store throwing out the unwanted produce at the end of the day that that otherwise is going to go off by tomorrow people say why don't they give it away they don't give it away because they want people to buy it tomorrow okay it is the sign of a healthy society they've got too much and so it gets thrown out it gets thrown into the bin yeah well why don't they do this why I don't know. Why doesn't the local kebab shop, as I argued, just give away the kebabs at the end of the night that they otherwise would have? Because they can't, because the local kebab shop doesn't know precisely, precisely, you know, down to the final kebab, exactly how much tomato and lettuce and lamb and bread that they need for each and every day. So they buy a little bit more than

### 53m

what they need and throw away some at the end of the day. Why don't they just give it away? They don't give it away because eventually the people in the community will realize, well, they're just giving kebabs away at the end of the day. Let's just wait until the end of the day and we'll get a free one. We won't buy one. That would be a terrible business model. No. So they purchase a little bit more than what they need and make just the right amount of profit. Usually just a tiny amount of profit, by the way. And this is true for almost every single business. Their profit margins are extremely tiny. Now, as a proportion, I mean, as a proportion of the total revenue. Okay. So the local kebab shop takes in, in one day, $2,000. But they're constantly giving away kebabs. They're giving away kebabs. They're giving away kebabs. They're giving away kebabs. They're giving away kebabs. They're giving away kebabs. They're giving away electricity, labor, food might be $1,900. They've got this tiny profit margin, $100 for the owner to go home with and pay his own personal bills with, something like that. And maybe the local grocery store, it's a bit more than that. Maybe Amazon, it's a bit more than that again. Okay. They seem

### 54m

to have high profits. But as an overall proportion of the revenue, not that great. Although with Amazon, of course, they've got lots and lots of smart people, lots and lots of technology trying to refine precisely how much they need. But again, they can't predict perfectly, perfectly how much of any particular good they need to produce or to buy. So sometimes they need to destroy some. They can't get it exactly right. They don't want to go under. They don't want to produce insufficient amounts because they're not making as much money as they otherwise would have. But they can't get it exactly right. So some stuff needs to be destroyed. Whatever the case, I'm not going to get involved in discussions with the local kebab store owner about why they're throwing out a couple of tomatoes at the end of the evening. Or my local supermarket about why they're throwing out food. I don't know. I don't have the relevant knowledge. That's the whole point. You need to have knowledge in that particular area. This is an area of expertise. Finance is an area of expertise. Economics is an area of expertise. Running a kebab shop is an area of expertise. Running Amazon is an area of expertise. Why people in the general

### 55m

public feel like they have to insert their opinion into how these businesses should run? I don't know. It is precisely equivalent. To contacting the local urologist and asking them why the number of syringes in their bin happens to be the number that it is. Or the number of tissues, dirty tissues happens to be what it is. You don't know. You've got no clue about what goes on inside that urological surgery. The urologist does. The nurses do. They're the relevant experts. Anyway, I'm not going to read through this entire thing. But just to make us aware that nature, this is one of the most prestigious scientific journals on the planet. Is producing articles, which are op-eds. These are op-eds. To be fair, it's called perspective. Why? Why have we got an opinion piece on economics? These people don't know economics. Abstract. For over half a century, worldwide growth and

### 56m

affluence has continuously increased resource use. Well, firstly, isn't that a wonderful thing? Worldwide growth and affluence. That's great. And by the way, it's for everyone. It's for everyone. Yes, some people have gotten more wealthy than others. What's the alternative to that? Not everyone can get equally, but we won't go down that road, okay? I've got my cosmological economics. Have a look at that one. It's not bad that there is inequality in the world. It simply isn't bad. We can imagine situations where the inequality gets way worse. We can imagine a world where the richest people on the planet, well, actually, no, on the planet, in the galaxy, richest people in the galaxy, own entire planets. They have 10 to the power of $50. And the poorest people, the poorest people only own entire islands on those planets. And they're merely trillionaires. And they sail around those planets on their expensive yachts. We can imagine a situation like that. Worse inequality, but everyone's better. No one dies of disease and catastrophe and whatever. We're just solving our interesting, creative, better problems of the future. So inequality is not a bad thing. Anyway, affluence is certainly not a bad thing.

### 57m

It's the very thing that enables people to solve problems is wealth. In other words, affluence. Okay. Affluence has continually increased resource use and pollutant emissions far more rapidly than have been reduced through better technology. What? We've increased pollutant? Well, to some extent, yeah, but not really. Like, I mean, again, the Industrial Revolution in London, the air quality was way, way, way worse. But now there are more people who are richer. So I guess overall in the entire globe, there's been multiple industrial revolutions, and there continue to be these technological revolutions, which are creating a little bit of pollution. But the pollution, well, the pollution isn't that bad. Let's just face it. It's not like, well, there are places in China, I know, okay, and a place in Africa, which haven't got to the level of technology that we have. But if we can get them there, then their skies will be clear as well. They'll have clean air as well. And then everyone can just worry about the invisible carbon dioxide.

### 58m

Yeah. Okay, fine. We can extract the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, if that's what people are worried about. We can get carbon sequestration going. We can get more plants and so on and so forth. Okay, let's just read the rest of this abstract. We're definitely not going to read the entire thing. The affluent citizens of the world are responsible for most environmental impacts and are central to any future prospect of retreating to safer environmental conditions. We summarize the evidence and present possible solution approaches. Marxism. Any transition towards sustainability can only be effective if far-reaching lifestyle changes. Authoritarianism. Tyranny. Okay, they're going to tell you what to do. Complement technological advancements. In other words, yeah, technology's not good enough. We need to control you. We need to be the authorities to take away some of your wealth and to regulate what you're going to do with your life.

### 59m

Okay, we're going to tell you what to do moment to moment. However, existing societies, economies, and cultures incite consumption expansion and the structural imperative for growth in competitive market economies. Inhibits necessary societal change. Necessary societal change. The great fear with these people is, of course, they think they know what's best for everyone, for the entire world. And they rely on the purported, the supposed authority of science in order to do this. They write in journals like Nature. They say, we are scientists. We are warning you. Recent scientists warning, says the introduction. Scientists are just people. And as we can see, often, completely and utterly, historically illiterate, economically illiterate. Yes, physicists are some of the smartest people in the world. But many of them, not all, many of them should stick to physics. Okay, just as, you know,

### 1h 0m

you're on Brook, someone I love. Stick to finance. Whenever he comments on physics, he gets it wrong. And I sort of mentally switch off. You don't know what you're talking about. But it's fine. And I think that sometime, if you don't take an interest in a certain subject, try not to opine on it. I take a casual interest in the economy and finance because I listen to you on Brook, amongst other things. And I read Thomas Sowell and I read various other books. But I'm not going to insert myself in a debate about who was the worst of the Roman emperors. Not my area of expertise. I imagine that there's actually a good debate to be had there. I am not a historian. There are areas of expertise. But why certain people think that they should write long pieces about things they clearly don't know about. I don't know. Let's just skip all the argument and skip to the conclusion because this has gone on, this rant has gone on for long enough. Super affluent. So they're very, very worried about the rich. This is the politics of envy, of course.

### 1h 1m

Politics of envy. Everyone can become affluent. Everyone can. Okay. Post-capitalist economy. In other words, social. It's been tried before. Capitalism is the new thing. Can we just say that? It's the new theory. Marxism, communism, socialism, they're all just versions of tribalism, collectivism, which has been tried before. It was tried on the African savannah. It was tried in medieval Europe with the king at the top. And basically just making sure that everyone beneath him got an equal amount, more or less. His family and the barons might have got a little bit more. But basically, the overabundance. The overwhelming majority of people got the same, okay, just the same way that in North Korea now. The same way as in China to a lesser extent. But still, there is a ruling class and then there's everyone else is equal. Okay. Do we want everyone else to be? No. We don't want everyone else equal. We want this new idea. The new idea is everyone gets to pursue their own happiness and their own wealth to the

### 1h 2m

extent that they want to and can, and to the extent that they're willing to work hard, work late hours, be creative. Do stuff. Do stuff that they want. Okay. And if they don't want to, then they don't get rewarded. This is the, it's simply the reality of the world. And at this point I have to say, because I did not grow up in a wealthy family. I did not. Okay. I got through university myself by working hard myself to pay my way through university. Okay. I worked hard to do that. It's terrible that I have to say that, but of course people come at you when you declare these kinds of things. When you, when you, when you, when you say things like this. When you say that what it takes is how it is, what it takes is hard work and creativity, but that is what it takes. That is what it takes. The only alternative is to rely on others. Yeah. That's the only other alternative. Okay. We don't really have a section called conclusion here. It says research on governance, how to make the world a better place according to nature.

### 1h 3m

Replace GDP as a measure of prosperity. Okay. Who cares about that? Empower people and strengthen participation in democratic processes. Stronger local governance. I don't mind stronger local governance. Yeah. Take a takeaway. The, the power from the, you know, centralized national governments. Happy with that. Design governance institutions will allow for social experiments, engagement and innovation. Sounds all nice. This could be trialed through organized or through citizen assemblies or juries. How about we just stick with democracy and easy way of removing the rulers and policies that we don't like as is demanded by extinction rebellion. Extinction. Rebellion. Oh my goodness. These are, these are these, uh, environmental terrorists and already practiced by transition initiative. Okay. So they've gone off that. So, uh, it seems like what they're arguing for there is not really democracy. Not really, um, more democratic processes, but entrenching certain leaders and certain ideas such that they cannot possibly be removed citizen assemblies or juries.

### 1h 4m

And whenever you hear something like that, you hear people who haven't been elected and therefore cannot be removed by election. Next third, strengthen equality and redistribution through suitable taxation policies. Okay. We need more tax basic income. Okay. Yes. Uh, universal basic income and job guarantees. In other words, job guarantees. All right. So you get a guaranteed job, even if you're not willing to do anything guaranteed job. So even if you don't work hard guaranteed job, you can sit there on your butt, not do anything, but your job is guaranteed. Therefore your income is guaranteed. You don't have to try hard. This is what happens in North Korea, by the way. It's what always happens that people have no motivation to do anything because they know that the harder they work, they're not going to get rewarded anymore. They get rewarded exactly the same as the guy sitting next to them. Who's not trying hard. They think that everyone's going to try hard in such an economy. They're not, they're not. Why would they, they're not going to get any more reward, expanding public services.

### 1h 5m

Okay. This is all socialists rolling back neoliberal reforms. EG is part of a green new deal. Oh my goodness. Okay. Stronger regulation might be in it. Okay. To ban certain products or ecologically destructive industries. Okay. So it's just all authoritarianism under the guise of environmentalism, uh, to take away people's wealth, prosperity, um, uh, motivation to work, motivation to be creative. Fourth, the transformation of economic systems can be supported with innovative business models. No, it can't be. Two things don't work together. You're not going to get an innovative business with a job guarantee. Encourage sharing and giving economies based on cooperation, communities and localized economy. What is it? It's like it's written by, I'm sorry, but you know, a, a, a group of first year university students and finally capacity building, knowledge transfer and education, including media and advertising to support local sufficient.

### 1h 6m

Okay. Okay. Okay. It's, it makes one quite emotional actually to read this. It's just so sad that, that the great institutions, great journals like nature, uh, magazines like the, the, the scientific American are going down this road. This is what people are reading. When I was growing up, I don't know that this was in the scientific American or nature. They weren't focused on economics. Why? Why, why? Well I kinda know. I mean. pay attention to what's said in the physics community and i want to pick on the physics community the astrophysics community i talk to some of these people they're marxists they're socialists they they they love socialist policy and one of the reasons is i guess um governments fund their research so they need to be very very pro-government they need to be very very pro the idea that everyone else will support them the scientists so scientists certain scientists

### 1h 7m

have a vested interest in this this is why we need desperately need new funding models for science and it's something away from the universities away from the traditional way of government funding this stuff because so long as the the scientists keep getting government funding or almost all their funding comes from government they're going to write articles like this they're going to try and encourage everyone else to try and let's face indoctrinate everyone else with propaganda so that they can continue to get money by this route via arguing that the catastrophe is coming the looming catastrophe is coming number one the only people that can save you from the looming catastrophe are the scientists so you better give them more money you better make society more egalitarian we need scientists we need scientists to be working on creative stuff creative fundamental things and it's time that we started to really question the people who are arguing for
