The Mother Military. Welcome to TopCast and to an episode more an editorial than an explainer video although I'll be doing some explaining and maybe some historical reflection. This is mainly my opinion on a certain topic du jour so to speak and as you would have seen from the title of the YouTube or podcast episode it's called The Mother Military. There have been concerns of late raised across many western nations of what appears to have been a turn in the traditions of our defence forces, the militaries of our world, our physical bulwark so to speak against the enemies of the enlightenment, what we turn to when diplomacy fails. Our defence forces, our militaries in the west have seemingly been focused to a worrying extent to some of us upon implementing certain policies and policies that are not in line with the principles of the military. Ideologies which could even be seen in part to be anti-enlightenment. Everyone is of course for

### 1m

diversity certainly of ideas in the west and even diversity of people yes but should for example physical standards in the military be lowered to accommodate let's say those with diverse abilities. So should we lower the capacity to run and carry weapons, cardiovascular and strength requirements, fitness in other words, the physical training standards because I don't know let's say some people are overweight or should we demand that they meet the minimum physical standards. Militaries across the world forever and a day have a long tradition of physical standards because well when the chips are down you want the fighting men and women to be ready to fight. They need to be in tip top shape and ever ready. We cannot predict when a disaster will happen and they need to be called upon.

### 2m

Importantly defence forces exist as deterrents. This may be as or even more important a function that they serve when set beside their literal fighting capabilities. The military needs to be seen to be a scary thing. It's rather like the argument for nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons exist at all because, well, our enemies have them. It deters them from attacking us because if they do so, our superior firepower, in particular in the form of the firepower from the United States, its nuclear capacity, and secondarily that of the UK, Europe, NATO, and the military capabilities of everywhere else, like South Korea, Japan, Israel, Australia, and Canada, would absolutely obliterate any attack from anywhere in the world. So finally and completely, there would be little left of any

### 3m

attacking nation or coalition of nations that attacked any member of the Allied West. The Western nations, led by the US and the UK and NATO, are a terrifying and dangerous potential foe, utterly unrivaled by any attack from anywhere in the world. So if we were to attack any of those nations, anything else on earth, our weapons say, do not test us. Do not push us too far. You would lose and you would lose badly. You might have weapons as well, but this would not, not be the trope of mutually assured destruction. It would be a one-sided annihilation. Sure, our potential enemies in China and Russia have nukes. We get that. But they are of a relatively ancient kind outdated. And we've seen already recently Russia in action in Ukraine. This so-called once upon a time superpower is basically relying on ancient, outdated military hardware. Poorly trained

### 4m

soldiers who have very little commitment to the cause, bad leadership and hopeless tactics. And as I say, superseded technology. China is a little better. Should these guys launch nukes, let's say, NATO would shoot them down almost immediately. And even if one did get through the defences to cause a disaster somewhere, the rain of fire that would come down in response on all their nuclear facilities with such ferocity and speed, those nations would be bombed back almost to a literal stone age. This, thankfully, is something the West does not want. And so it is a virtuous thing that they know what we could do. And we know they know what we could do and what they could do. And what they could do, set beside what we can do, is not much. This is how things really do stand at the moment. The difference in

### 5m

defence and attack capabilities of Western nations versus those who oppose us really is the difference between Western technology more broadly in the form of Apple and Tesla and Google and whatever Russia's got, and the cheap imitations of those things that China steals, mainly from the U.S. and South Korea from time to time. It is the difference between nations in the West, the Enlightenment tradition, dynamic societies that tend in the direction of a tradition of criticism, and the more static societies that tend in the direction of authoritarianism. The entire difference there is that the more static societies that tend in the direction of authoritarianism, the more static societies that tend in the direction of authoritarianism, the more static societies the more static societies that tend in the direction of calor việc in a rather severe manner and

### 6m

if we我们这就是我们会不知不觉的⋯balls come one another across the two ㅎㅎ française your annihilation of one versus the other. Just to linger on this for the moment before I get to the main point of this podcast, this is not merely a story of numbers, although the differences are staggering. Look at the difference here in terms of military spending of NATO nations, where we have over a trillion dollars being spent, and something like a third of that number being spent by the coalition of China and Russia. On average compared to the rest of the world, Western nations, NATO, spend 141% of the global average on defence, whereas China and Russia only spend 44%

### 7m

compared to the average on defence. Far, far less. And that's merely the numbers. That spending of money, due to the difference in wealth between the nations, makes all the difference. It is the difference between well-paid soldiers and those who can't be bothered fighting, and instead want a better life, likely in Western nations where we are. It is also the difference between more and less effective equipment, even if the total number of, let's say, guns and artillery might be less in Western nations. Who cares about those numbers? Our guns and artillery? Our guns and artillery are better, period. Many in the West, who have a naive understanding of how these things work, look at the numbers of soldiers, let's say, active military personnel, or those that might be available to fight, and think, wow, China and Russia outdo us in some ways.

### 8m

Look at these numbers. In terms of active personnel, NATO has more, something like 3.1 million. China and Russia, a little over 3 million. million. So it's similar there. The reserves, China and Russia, have far more than what we do. In terms of available for military, we, by we I mean NATO, sure Australia's not in NATO, but we would be on the side of NATO obviously in any conflict. Available for military service, 205, 206 million. China and Russia, 420, 421 million. That's a lot more, that's more than double. But really? Really? Would all 420 fighting men and women really be committed to the fight? Would they? I don't think so. I think a lot of them would want to leave, as they do right now

### 9m

during peacetime. In wartime, they'd absolutely want to leave those countries. So who cares about those numbers? Moreover, even if we just focus on the active personnel where the numbers are similar, who's better trained? Who's more motivated? Who actually knows how to operate the equipment they have? Who has equipment that actually works and won't run out of ammunition or fuel or fail just due to a lack of maintenance? And in modern warfare, yes, sure, ground forces are important, but the overwhelming difference comes down to air power in any modern war. And we can see here the difference in total number of aircraft, of NATO versus China. We completely outclassed them here. Nowadays, air power makes all the difference in terms of devastating the occupants of the nations of the aggressor. That is what makes the difference in morale in any modern war. Western fighter jets and bombers are simply

### 10m

streets ahead of anything China and Russia have, which are at best poor copies of Western military technology. And again, how well maintained are Chinese and Russian craft? If the Ukraine war is anything to go by, not very. And how reliable are their logistical lines? How well protected are their airports? Can we easily bomb their runways and destroy what little air forces they do have before they can ever use the equipment they have? And as Jocko Willink points out, Western nations employ a tactic known as decentralized command. China and Russia are authoritarian to the core. No one is willing to do anything for fear of being literally lined up against the wall and shot. So they won't take the initiative, politically and militarily. They will always await orders. That's their tradition. And who's giving the orders in those countries? Other

### 11m

people who won't give any orders until they're told exactly what to do by the dictators at the top. And as I'm speaking in 2023, that is Vladimir Putin in Russia and Xi Jinping in China. But the US, the UK and NATO don't operate that way. We have a different set of military traditions now. The officers and soldiers of those militaries, modern Western militaries, are trained to think creatively, be proactive and take charge. This too makes all the difference. A creative approach to fighting. It's not as much top-down. Sure, it still is top-down, but it is far more an individualist approach. It's not as much as a military approach. It's not as much as a military approach. Of course, there's absolutely discipline in Western militaries and orders are given. Of course, that thing is similar. But the orders are in the form of objectives. And everyone at every rank knows they are responsible. In authoritarian regimes, everyone is too afraid to take the

### 12m

initiative for fear of stepping out of line. But the West rewards sensible stepping out of line, taking the initiative, being a leader. In China and Russia, there is only, in China and Russia, there is only one leader. And he does not share power. So in modern military conflicts, it's not just a story of numbers. It's a story of cultures and capabilities. It is about modernity versus aging and decaying defense material. It is often said, for example, that North Korea has one of the largest armies on earth. Well, okay. But you dig in and you notice a few things. Firstly, the soldiers are paid terribly. And secondly, the soldiers are paid terribly. How committed would they be to a war when they begin to starve? Worse, what's their equipment like? I can tell you, I've read the accounts and recent history on this. And it is kind of hilarious in certain respects. There are just these laughable tales of soldiers

### 13m

unable to drive their own trucks because they've never learned to. They don't have the money for the fuel to go around training every soldier who would need to drive a truck during wartime. How to drive the truck. Because they don't have the resources, number one. But number two, there's also these ridiculous authoritarian rules. And the overwhelming majority of weapons they have are decades old. They've got insufficient fuel for their vehicles and insufficient training of people who would operate those vehicles. They've got insufficient ammunition. Morale as low as anywhere on the planet. A place where the military themselves, the frontline soldiers, are as likely to turn the wheel. And they're not going to be able to turn the wheel. And they're not going to turn on their own leaders or just surrender as attack any invading force. So numbers are never the whole story. They're barely any part of the story. And all of what I've said just there about North Korea applies in part two to China and Russia. We've seen that in Ukraine. These places

### 14m

with these huge militaries are actually weak militarily. Sure, you can Google numbers about how many tanks Russia has. But you can't see how many tanks Russia has. And you can't see how many tanks Russia and China have versus the West. Or how much artillery they have. And it might look as if Russia and China on some metric have more. But how effective are they? How old are they? What is their range and accuracy? In the first Gulf War, a war-hardened Iraqi military fresh from fighting Iran and with vast numbers of powerful tanks with experienced units inside them were easily defeated in a range war by the U.S. The United States, there to defend Kuwait from the invading Iraqis, simply destroyed Iraqi tank after tank, one at a time, because they were firing from beyond the range of the old Iraqi Soviet tanks. It was an obliteration. This included, among other battles, the so-called

### 15m

Battle of Medina Ridge. And I remember as a young boy in high school getting up early in the morning in 1991 before the sun rose to watch the latest news about it. And I remember as a young boy in high school getting up early in the morning to watch the latest news about this. And other tank battles. Because, well, my father was once a tank driver in what's called the CMF, the Citizen Military Forces in Australia in the late 1960s, early 1970s. So I heard about tanks. And I was excited about tanks. And, you know, being a little boy, and here I was, witnessing the first real-life televised war happening before my eyes on the screen. And so I was fixated on the details. The M1 Abrams tanks passing the Soviet T-72 tanks of Iraq, those T-72 tanks had proven themselves in previous wars over and again, but they were no match for the modern American tanks. Does anyone doubt that even with China and Russia having upgraded some of their material, that it's not still true today?

### 16m

Whatever China, Russia, North Korea, whoever, whatever they've got is still going to be ancient by comparison. To what we have, superseded by the US, the UK, NATO, South Korea, Israel and others. Look, Israel once took on the militaries of five nations who simultaneously invaded it in 1948. Five nations they took on at once with no help. And they won. Israel won. And ever since, this nation has had to live in a region where nations still have a policy to this day that they should not exist. That they should be pushed into the sea. That they are illegitimate. And on the global scale, in the United Nations, that Israel's defending of themselves is somehow an attack. And so it goes. This is what David Deutch refers to as the pattern,

### 17m

which undergirds anti-Semitism. It is maintaining the legitimacy of hurting Jews. But let me not go down that road right now. Among many other factors, not least superior ideology. Consistently full of ideas, construction, brave ideology, and ideas, and the greater moral claim, and stronger allies, Israel itself Italy does not exist simply has better technology than those surrounding it. More committed and better trained fighters, more promising tactics, but it is their strategy to take, the trend in the West. They are of the West. They are in the enlightenment tradition. A tradition of criticism. So this tiny place in the Middle East is an island absolutely bristling with power. Buy and multiply that by an order order of magnitude and you've got something like the UK and the US, NATO and their allies. But we cannot be complacent. They, the enemies of the West, are bellicose. They are plagued with bad ideas. They, our enemies, are likely to make silly errors, putting themselves, their own people, in

### 18m

danger and hence our people as well. They are a danger to the world, in short, these regimes, and so we must ever be on guard with powerful defence forces to deter them from making silly errors. So it is also a difference of ideas. Authoritarianism and anti-democratic institutions and anti-enlightenment ideals not only make nations weak and their people supine, but also militaries weak and soldiers supine. This difference only grows over time, especially as members of the weaker societies look to the West. The West with envy and admiration. And many of them leave to come here. It is no accident there is a net movement out of Russia and China to other places. The USA is the most desirable place in the world. The UK, NATO countries more broadly, as well as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Israel are not far behind. People are fighting to get into those places and out of places like China,

### 19m

Russia and North Korea. Indeed, with North Korea, the regime there is fighting to keep people in. Another difference that makes all the difference in the world. So all of that, everything I've said so far, is just a preamble. Because my point here is, why would we ever want to do anything to make it seem like we are taking a backward step in the eyes of our enemies, in becoming, let's say, more like them? In particular, why would we want to turn our military from being the sharp point of our worldview into something far more nebulous and distracted from its central mission to defend, to be a physical fighting force, to become more mothering. The mother military, in other words. Mothers are powerful, of course. Mothers defend their children. It's true. And to the death, they would.

But they don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it. They don't enjoy it all. Mothers generally attack their own children. They are the soft place for children to fall. The traditional role of mother and father has evolved for a reason. And while there are many aspects of these traditional gender roles to criticise, it is important to notice some aspects of how Maine the informs the understanding of ghostness as well as the vision of womanhood as a jeux, it suggests a And so here's the bottom line. England was of course the middle Digital Commonwealth . significatively traditional in And so here's the bottom line. England was of course the middle Digital Commonwealth . significatively traditional in exists for example in North Korea a place I've studied to some extent and I live with my own personal Douglas Murray who is an expert in this area and he has informed me over many years about this kind of thing and this is what I'm going to explain to you some of his perspective on this this is Jeremy Allen who is a literal expert in Korea and Asia with university degrees in that

### 21m

area but more importantly than that someone who is absolutely committed to studying the history and the modern politics of this area and what I'm about to say to you is a mingling of my ideas with his ideas the Kims the Kim regime in North Korea and the Communist Party aren't just the fathers of the nation they're the mothers of the nation too it is a trope and perhaps unfair but observed by people like Jordan Peterson for example that while men will engage in physical fighting when conflict arises between them the female reaction to conflict to dissent or to being perceived as others not loving them enough is not to engage in a physical confrontation quite so often but rather to gossip and publicly shame and then to rally your friends around you now this gossip shame and rally style this feminine way of engaging in conflict is

### 22m

precisely what happens to people in North Korea who say anything about the mother government the gossip happens when the Inminbam which is a kind of community leader that exists in every town in North Korea notices something amiss the shaming happens through literal weekly criticism sessions look that up and then the rally happens through getting the society government and arms of the government the police the law courts and the military to side with them the gossip mongers against you the subject of the gossip and the rumor because you might have said something against the mother government so what's this got to do with us who cares what they do in North Korea well this is an exact reflection of what has come to be known as cancel culture in our society where gossip shame and rally is the normal way

### 23m

to deal with a dissenting view nowadays modern woke culture can be seen in much the same way you are supposed to love it and can't be ungrateful to it because it is at least in large part a movement which claims to be by women for women using feminine rather than masculine urges and emotional tendencies and the woke see themselves as doing something fundamentally good for everyone expect these people not to pay shade at anyone while masculinity is toxic femininity is the anti-venom at the heart of today's cultural landscape and the west while to hurt a man's feelings is ok because men should suck it up to do her to women's feelings is to transgress a terrible taboo and this hurting of feelings can come down to me criticism no matter how vallette under taboo women should never be mired in a cult that never sideways at high

### 24m

risk drugs acting as soldiers be criticized under this mode of thinking but rather they should always be validated they need to be validated and affirmed as do lgbtqia plus people and other minorities while men are seen as the cause of all or almost all society's wrongs so of course it's only men who are according to this ideology only men are the valid recipients of criticism again this is on this view mind you on the woke view not in reality we see it all the time in advertising the advertising trope is the stupid father and the wise mother it is homer simpson versus marge and lisa it is peter griffin versus lois it is phil dumphy the father from modern family versus his wife women are portrayed over and again as competent and strong men are the bumbling fools alpha males so to speak are

### 25m

just not funny or appealing rather much of the time according to woke sensibilities and yes i get it it's a reaction to the past when men were always portrayed as being virtuous and women were always portrayed as subservient but now the pendulum has swung in the other direction and we shouldn't be afraid to call this out and recognize it for what it is i mean today we can witness how far the pendulum has swung because look at this trans ideology that's happening right now if a man transitions to a woman he is now a she whose feelings you are hurting if you criticize them if a woman transitions to a man it was a woman's agency that made the decision in the first place so she now he needs to be validated and affirmed as well with increasingly more perhaps most of the academic and now legal class being made up of women the concept of men being a

### 26m

subclass of human pervades education and academia and the legal consequences of the decisions by women at the top are largely forgiven by society at least if they're on the left politically anyway but i don't just mean leaders i also mean in day-to-day life amongst the average person look at what happens during divorce proceedings custody battles and alimony payments and the like and i'm not saying that women are the only ones who are allowed to make those payments now it's common knowledge in western nations that these decisions favor the mother almost all of the time despite the mother sometimes being the egregiously wrong party not always not always but often if a woman has children when she's single in a society like australia at least single parenting payments are awarded by the government meaning women are either able to fund their poor decisions or lifestyle choices through the balance sheet

### 27m

of a current or former partner or just through taxpayers in society at large through tax collection and income redistribution new zealand is similar in this regard in this way the government becomes the mother similarly to the way work ideology operates because the government is setting itself up to be incapable of being criticized because if you do you're essentially hurting a woman's feelings by not being sufficiently grateful everything she does by providing for you doing an essential good even if you can't see it in the present moment this again echoes north korea where the mother party can't be criticized or if not can't be in the west then shouldn't be it's not a good look to criticize the welfare state let's say where the rubber hits the road with the military however is that they are moving into the same

### 28m

sphere as evidenced by the evolution of militarism while performing military service as well as the concept of being a military that cares and nurtures its soldiers have a look at jameson's travels videos for further material about this this then extends presumably to those that the military comes into contact with during its overseas deployments the military has moved from being a father figure the just wait until your father gets home kind of thing heir of impending force to be reckoned with to being another feminized institution which cannot be criticized lest its feelings be hurt i mean the recent u.s. army recruitment ad which was heavily criticized by people turned off its comments on the youtube video because you wouldn't want to hurt the feelings of the u.s. army would you the military is meant to be detached from emotions in order to carry out its duties effectively

### 29m

and in a functioning democracy the military is meant to be detached from emotions and in a functioning democracy it should be criticized and held to account for its actions if we want to find a society where this weird concept of the military is prevalent and we need look no further than once again north korea criticism of the military there is absolutely beyond the pale because the military provides not merely stability but employment a sense of political continuity the same way a mother provides stability a fairer share of resources to meet the needs of each member of the household and a sense of continuity which binds the family together to criticize that aspect of society or family is to bring the entire thing crashing down in other words in the West what we have the early signs where the military is concerned and I don't think this is a slippery slope not yet but it is signs of a creeping kind of totalitarianism in

### 30m

which the government and the military is not to be as easily criticized because it has become a mothering type institution or institutions and to criticize means questioning the very underpinnings of our society the rise of the feminization of social issues and by extension the government which is seen as responsible for managing those in today's world as well as the creeping feminization of the military puts these institutions into a new and untested space in Western societies conversely over and over again from first verse putting the government and the military into that space has been tested before in other societies and was seen as reasons that democracy should be superseded or even ended entirely and the status quo of the mother being beyond criticism maintained on a permanent basis all of this to me is reminiscent of Alan Watts prickles and goo

### 31m

now if you haven't seen Warren what 왔壓干 jets be betterities of all times this was a設計 I'm transcript from The British Channel above WB 쓰는 tectonics English lasprosy in English essay An 어디 한번準備енного I tried to write this first verse in English though day and a half before reading the 빌 Watts prickles and goo video right here you haven't heard him talk about this then pause this video and go and watch it right now it is crucial viewing to understand what I'm about to say but also just because you know it's a few minutes long and it's deeply insightful now Alan Watts never spoke about this prickles versus goo thing as being male versus female energy or the stereotypical more feminine versus masculine traits but I will now no value judgment is being made here no value judgment is being made here like what I think that prickles and goo male and female are both necessary both necessary to understand the world because reality is prickles and goo or kiki and booba or as Alan says prickly goo or gooey prickles you

### 32m

prickles is kind of like the discrete goo is like the continuous again go watch the video I fully admit you know in terms of personality online I'm more prickles than goo at times anyways catch me around my friends and I'm almost entirely goo prickly goo perhaps but I'm not online I get that I want to speak clearly in this clipped sort of tone that Alan Watts talks about and that's prickly there are no contradictions in reality and I want to speak clearly in this clipped sort of tone that I want to understand reality here but you know personal relationships require goo because other people are often gooey so you have to meet them in their gooey complexity it's not like I'm a completely different person online and offline it's just horses for courses but this video this podcast is not about me or personal relationships booba and kiki or prickles and goo or discrete and continuous are basically ways of talking about everything

### 33m

because everything consists of prickly discrete stuff and gooey continuous stuff it's both together we human beings are people and are universal as I talk about so often here and in principle can understand everything or rather anything but we tend to focus on certain things men broadly speaking tend to focus on prickles women on the goo generally generally but it's true there are masculine women and feminine men gay men are often thought feminine but that's only half true the other half are known as butch the former a camp in the gay world neither are judged as superior they just aren't no matter what some factions might say the point I am making is about broad generalizations I'm doing the James Damore thing remember him I'm talking about the mean the average when

### 34m

of course there's a bell curve and we admit that populations of men and women have this bell curve distribution but that's not to deny there isn't an average going on here with these traits we don't deny the outliers exist but means and medians exist so let's go back to the military and what is regarded by many as the western tendency recently of feminizing the military needs to be prickles it just does mothers need to be goo babies need love and doting but there comes a time for prickles kids must learn about the harshness and sharpness of the world that they are being nurtured within this isn't saying children need coercion this isn't saying be mean to children this is saying they need to be exposed to reality kids must learn about

### 35m

the harshness and sharpness of the world the father traditionally serves that role for right or wrong that's the traditional gender role fathers just traditionally have been a little more prickly and it's not a bad thing at all nor is goo a bad thing both are needed to understand the dichotomies of the world light and shade right and wrong good and evil creativity criticism conjecture refutation the dichotomies in the world success failure so it goes approaching them through prickles and goo is needed the military is prickles nursing is goo medicine is both it's prickly goo but there is pathological prickles and pathological goo the latter is what jordan peterson referring to carl jung calls the devouring mother one of the four types of mothering impulses according to jung

### 36m

the devouring mother is pathological goo pathological prickles is male aggression that tips into initiating violence violent criminals in other words men kill other people they rape and they steal not that some women don't do this as well remember the distinction between the mean and the distribution but women when goo goes wrong destroy lives not typically through violence and murder although that can happen again means versus transformations but women destroy people's lives through devouring gossip over protection authoritarianism desire and control the motherland that's russia we'll do everything for you says communism we'll control you sure they also use male violence as hitler did and stalin did but ultimately the state becomes the devouring mother in totalitarian regimes it is both

### 37m

parents mother and son the state becomes the devouring mother in totalitarian regimes it is both parents mother and father at the level of the state, prickles and goo, working hand in glove to tyrannize the world. But it begins with mothering at first before dad gets called in. Wait until your father gets home. In other words, the military comes to us with friendly, soft overtones of like, well, we're here for you all of the time. We are you and you are us. And when you reject their overbearing softness and their attempt to be mother to all, then they say, well, now dad's here. And the military literally gets violent against its own people. This is what happens in totalitarian regimes. I'm not saying it's happened yet. I'm saying this is what goes on in places like China. Do we want a softer military? Do we want a mother military? Do we want a gooey military focused on LGBTQIA plus diversity? Do we want to show anything other than motherhood? Do we want to show anything other than motherhood? Do we want to show anything other than prickles to our enemy? There is a place for goo in the home, in welfare, charity and

### 38m

generosity. But in the military, that's prickles. In MMA and UFC, it's all prickles. The police are mainly prickles, but they're gooey prickles. We want them to be nice at times, especially to law abiding citizens and to some kinds of petty criminals. Police need to be able to show compassion. But there is much less place for compassion on the front lines of the military. Yes, absolutely. In the West, we take prisoners. We show mercy to the enemy who surrenders. But otherwise, it's win, win, win. The military is only ever used when civilization is threatened. So we want prickles. We don't need soft, inclusive mothering. Let's welcome everyone. No, we want hard, difficult to get in, hard to get through, tough, protective father. That's the military. It's not inclusive. It's a very exclusive club

### 39m

of tough men and women. It's not about love and inclusion. It's the bouncer at the door with a scowl on his face, excluding people. Sure, on a very tight leash of the manager of the club, the democratically elected government, in other words, in the West. But that's because the bouncer is ever looking outwards at those who aren't inside yet. He's prickly. He, the masculine energy. We want that guy. He's the guy even at the gay club who's letting everyone from all walks of life into the club. But you want a particularly tough guy at the gay club. Let me tell you, you don't want the camp feminine twink standing at the door deciding who comes in and out. He'll be walked over. You want the big butch guy who knows how to fight. He's not tolerating any BS. And when the manager comes to the bouncer and says, that guy there, he's not coming in. Well, that guy isn't getting past the bouncer. That's the military. That's our military. And

### 40m

traditionally, that's been our military. He's the biggest, baddest guy around. So it's quite right that people are upset about anything that lowers standards or makes the military seem like they're doing anything other than being a scary fighting force, ready to die for the rest of us, because that's their job. It's not to provide opportunity or to make anyone feel good about themselves. It's about doing a particular job, to be the prickles so that other people in our society are free to be as gooey as they like. Check out the differences between advertisements.
