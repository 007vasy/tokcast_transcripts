Memes. The mistakes when it comes to minds and what a person is, and how they are not just a little, but very significantly, even qualitatively different to all other things in the universe, including other animals, even complex animals like dogs and great apes, are multitudinous. They begin in the epistemology in what knowledge even is, and how it can be created, and what can possibly create it, especially explanatory knowledge. If the epistemology begins in deep misconceptions, already known to be false, like knowledge can be derived from the senses, then one is apt if talking about systems that can learn as systems that can derive knowledge from sense data. They gather from the environment. A system that has been programmed with the knowledge of what a map is, and how a map is to be generated by shining lights and lasers which reflect from surfaces, to then be analysed by photomultipliers, cameras and computers, converted to data, then randomly moving to another spot in a room, is a useful system for a robotic vacuum cleaner to have.

### 1m

But that robot is not learning to make a map. It has already been coded with that knowledge. The programmer knew what a map was. They knew how to make the map. And now, the robot is effectively a universal mapmaker for two-dimensional surfaces meeting certain strict criteria like, for example, not encountering bodies of water. The robot is not learning anything. It is merely gathering data to make a specific map. Sure, it was not programmed with the specific map of the room it is now in. But that is not... creative work for it. All the actually creative work was done elsewhere at another time in the mind of the programmer. How exactly maps in general of this kind are constructed. That's the actual creative work.

### 2m

Now, any specific map to be made of any room, a floor plan in other words, can be automated. The robot has no new ideas. It is a mindless machine. But we people can create new maps. Many have seen these so-called... Mercator Projection of the map of the Earth. It is the one seen most often. It tries to get the shape of the land masses right. But because the true Earth is approximately a sphere, the areas of the continents are misleading. A so-called Peter's Projection also attempts to project the surface of the spherical Earth onto a flat piece of paper and get the areas right. But this comes at the expense of the shape of the continents, which now become more misleading. Only a globe itself... preserves both shape and area. Maps of all kinds are memes. Ideas that persist to be passed on. That people can create new kinds of maps sets us apart from machines.

### 3m

We can make memes. But to make memes, we first need to have an idea. Not all ideas survive. Many we have, we almost immediately think, no, bad idea, that won't work. And it's forgotten. Some ideas we might keep to ourselves our entire life. And never pass on to anyone else. Those aren't memes either. A meme needs to cause a behaviour in the person with the idea. And then, that behaviour must be observed by someone else. Who then tries to understand the meaning behind the behaviour and emulate it. This is how memes get copied. Behaviour might very well be someone physically moving. Like how one would teach a child to wave at someone new. Or it might be literal speech. Or writing. Something that causes something to happen out in the objective world. Beyond the mind that has a meaning to the person who does the talking. Or the writing. Or something else. And which others can guess the meaning.

### 4m

They guess the meaning. And so themselves have an idea. Which could be a more or less accurate representation of the original idea. And then they engage in behaviours which others can observe. And so it goes. With the meme being replicated. This is how memes are replicated. We cannot copy the contents of each other's minds directly. So this is yet another difference between us and all other systems including artificial intelligence. Present AI, being a regular computer, can have the ideas represented in its code. Which is really an imperfect representation of the idea of the programmer. Copied directly from computer to computer with arbitrarily high accuracy. A program in a mindless computer can. Be copied. But ideas and minds are different. The only known way for us to get our idea into the mind of another person is to. For example. Speak some words. But those sounds we called words must be interpreted.

### 5m

Indeed. First one must interpret their own thoughts into language and then speak them. And those words are then interpreted by one's interlocutor. And this whole chain of transmission is highly error prone. How often do you think or even say each week. No. That's not what I meant exactly. When trying to get a message across. It is remarkable how memes do get fatally replicated. But it is quite understandable. They also change over time because they are imperfectly copied. And so it is with maps. Memes about how to represent the world. The map is not the territory as people say. And knowledge itself is like a map. A representation of reality that can be more or less accurate. And can increase the fidelity with which it represents reality over time. Some maps. Like the Mercator projection are better in some contexts. Like the Peters projection than others. But they both persist. Good explanations are memes. But so are good jokes. And good fiction. And good songs and art and more besides.

### 6m

Memes are ideas that survive. And minds are the makers of memes.
