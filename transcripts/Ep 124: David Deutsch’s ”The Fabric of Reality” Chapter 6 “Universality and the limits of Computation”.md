Welcome to TalkCast and to Chapter 6 of my breakdown of the Fabric of Reality. Chapter 6 is called, titled, Universality and the Limits of Computation. Now, David Deutsch is expert in the topics he writes about in The Beginning of Infinity and in the Fabric of Reality. But if we were to talk wheelhouses, as people sometimes do, the thing that you spend your career, your life, pursuing, then this is one of those. David Deutsch has a lot of wheelhouses. But this is certainly one right in the dead centre of David Deutsch's professional interests. One of the reasons for David Deutsch's fame among other physicists is because of his contribution to this area of science, which we call computational computer science. In fact, it really was. Down to David to bring computer science into science itself.

### 1m

Before that, it was treated as an area of mathematics, of pure mathematics, treated in the abstract. And it was David who explained how and why it should be regarded more as a part of physics. It's a simple idea. Computers are made of matter. Matter obeys the laws of physics. Therefore, what computers can do is bounded by the laws of physics. This particular chapter. Is one of my favourites in the entire book. It is insight bomb after insight bomb. Which means I am going to take my time with passages here. Even more so than what I normally would. In order to break them down or emphasise them. But I'm going to begin just by reading the first paragraph on the first page of the book. And then I'm going to skip rather a lot. And I'll explain why in just a moment. But let's get into the reading. And perhaps for those picking it up. In this episode, for whatever reason. The last episode was about virtual reality generators.

### 2m

Now why on earth would one write a book about the fabric of reality. About cosmically significant things. And concentrate on something seemingly as parochial and as quirky as virtual reality. Well there is an important reason why. And that is because we human beings, our minds, are essentially virtual reality rendering machines. We are minds and we are connected to the rest of real things. And we are connected to physical reality via senses. Which are creating for us an impression of the environment. It's a virtual reality rendering of whatever real reality happens to be. Which we don't have direct access to. So virtual reality, a study of virtual reality, not only gives an insight into the workings of people. But things that can do computations more broadly. And hence, David begins the chapter with. Quote. The heart of a virtual reality generator. Is its computer. And the question of what environments can be rendered in virtual reality. Must eventually come down to the question of what computations can be performed.

### 3m

Even today the repertoire of virtual reality generators is limited as much by their computers. As by the image generators. Whenever a new faster computer with more memory and better image processing hardware. Is incorporated into a virtual reality generator. The repertoire is enlarged. But will it always be so? Or will we eventually encounter full universality. As I have argued we should expect in the case of image generators. In other words. Is there a single virtual reality generator. Buildable. Once and for all. That could be programmed to render any environment. That the human mind is capable of experiencing. End quote. But I might just. I would just pick up a couple of short paragraphs here. Which speak about the limitations of computers. The way in which computers. Must be limited by the laws of physics. A taster. So to speak. Of. Why it is that there are these limitations placed upon computers.

### 4m

David writes. Quote. A computer with an effectively unlimited memory capacity. Can be envisaged in principle. But a computer with an unlimited speed. Of computation. Cannot. A computer of given design will always have a fixed maximum speed. Which only design changes can increase. End quote. Now why is this? Well because we've got this limitation on. Imposed by. The speed of light. Stuff can't happen faster than the speed of light. And so signals can't be sent. Faster than the speed of light. At the speed of light. Sure. But not faster than the speed of light. So you have this. Inherent limitation imposed by the laws of physics. Let's just read on a little bit further. Quote. Therefore a given virtual reality generator will not be able to perform. Unlimited amounts of computation per unit time. Will this not limit its repertoire? If an environment is so complex. That the computation. Of what the user should be seeing. One second from now. Takes the machine more than one second to compute. How can the machine possibly render that environment accurately? To achieve universality.

### 5m

We need a further. Technological trick. To extend its repertoire as far as is physically possible. A virtual reality generator. Would have to take control. Of one further attribute of the user sensory system. Namely. The processing speed. Of the user's brain. If the human brain will like an electronic computer. This would simply be a matter of changing. The rate at which its clock. Emits synchronizing pulses. No doubt the brain's clock will not be so easily controlled. But again. This presents no problem. Of principle. The brain. Is a finite physical object. And all its functions. Are physical processes. Which in principle. Can be slowed down. Or stopped. The ultimate virtual reality generator. Would have to be capable of doing that. End quote. Now. I'm ending. The quotation there. Because then David goes into. The details about. How virtual reality generators could. Be built that could. Even tinker with your own brain. The mechanics of this.

### 6m

Is interesting. And it's worthwhile. Of course. I presume. That people who are listening to this. Have access to the book. So. It might be well worth your while. Going to the book. And reading the few pages. That I'm going to. Gloss over here. I'm just going to skip over. Because. It's about the technical details of. How one might go about. In the distant future. In a technologically enlightened future. Where. We could directly. Intercept the contents of. Neurons. Let's say. And so give you the experience. Of. Whatever is. Physically possible to experience. Via that method of. Directly. Intervening. In. The neurons. The action of the neurons. We don't need to go into that. Please explore. This part of the chapter. No doubt. The vast majority of people. Listening to this. Have the book. If you don't. Get the book. And read the details. Because they are interesting. But basically. Look. The idea is. That with. You know. An advanced neuroscience. With a cybernetic implant. It's going to be possible. To tinker.

### 7m

With neurons. And hence. Subjective experience. Given the requisite. Knowledge. Knowing how to do that. The laws of physics. Do not. Prohibit. This from happening. So it must be possible. Given the right knowledge. So I'm skipping those. Details. Interesting though they are. I'm. Thinking over them. Because the sum of everything. David says. Is. Basically. Encapsulated by. What he goes on to say. Quote. For our present purposes. Technological obstacles. Are irrelevant. We are not investigating. What sorts of. Virtual reality generator. Can be built. Or even. Necessarily. What sorts of. Virtual reality generator. Will ever be built. By human engineers. We are investigating. What the laws of physics. Do. And do not allow. In the way. Of virtual reality. The reason why. This is important. Is nothing to do. With the prospects. For making. Better virtual reality. Generators. It is that the relationship. Between. Virtual reality. And ordinary reality. Is part. Of the deep. Unexpected. Structure. Of the world.

### 8m

Which this. Book is about. End quote. That's why I begin. This episode. In the way that I did. It's not an esoteric. Quirky. Sort of. Bit of technology. This virtual reality stuff. It provides. An insight. Into. How it is. That knowledge. About the world. And what our situation. Is. What our relationship. Is. With the rest. Of physical reality. David goes on. Quote. By considering. Various tricks. Nerve stimulation. Stopping. And starting. The brain. And so on. We have managed. To envisage. A physically. Possible. Virtual reality. Generator. Whose repertoire. Covers. The entire. Sensory. Range. As fully. Interactive. Repertoire. Be the set. Of all. Logically. Possible. Environments. It would not. Even this. Futuristic. Machines. Repertoire. Is drastically. Circumscribed. By the mere. Fact.

### 9m

Of its. Being. A physical. Object. It does not. Even scratch. The surface. Of what is. Logically. Possible. As I. Shall. Now. Show. You. How. You. Can. Do. It. Can. Do. Even. A. Machine. Which. Can. Render. All. Environments. That. Can. Be. Experienced. By. A. Person. Does. Not. Contain. In. Its. Repertoire. By. Trying. To. Define. Into. Existence. The. Machine. That. Can. Do. Anything. When. It. Comes. To. Virtual.

### 10m

Reality. It. Can. Render. Any. Environment. We're. About. To. Say. That. In. Our. Machine. Is. A. Machine. We're. All. In. The. Machine. That. Can. Be. A. Repertoire. Is. A. Machine. Is. A. Repertoire. Is. A. Machine. Is. A. Machine. Is. A. Some program for its computer. Imagine the set of all valid programs for this computer. From a physical point of view, each such program specifies a particular set of values for physical variables on the disks or other media that represent the computer's program. We know from quantum theory that all such variables are quantized

### 11m

and therefore that no matter how the computer works, the set of possible programs is discrete. Each program can therefore be expressed as a finite sequence of symbols in a discrete code or computer language. There are infinitely many such programs, but each one can contain only a finite number of symbols. That is because symbols are physical objects made of matter in recognizable configurations and one could not manufacture an infinite number of them. As I shall explain in Chapter 10, these intuitively obvious physical requirements that the programs must be quantized and that each of them must consist of a finite number of symbols and can be executed in a sequence of steps are more substantive than they seem. They are the only consequences of the laws of physics that are needed as input for the proof, though they are enough to impose drastic restrictions on the repertoire of any physically possible machine. Other physical laws may impose even more restrictions, but they would not affect the conclusions of this chapter."

### 12m

Okay, so what we've got here is the setup of the concept that we have, this computer, and the computer can run an infinite number of different programs, but it has a repertoire, which means the set of all programs, and the set can be infinite, of course. You can have infinite sets, the lists that are infinitely long, okay? There's no end to them, so there's no end to the number of programs in this set. It's infinite. Now, some people have a lot of difficulty with this concept that if something is infinite, it might not necessarily contain everything logically possible. But a simple way of understanding this is, you just think of the set of all positive numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, off into infinity. It clearly doesn't contain all the numbers, okay? Specifically, if you were to say, well, it's only the integers, well, it doesn't contain a half, a third, and so on and so forth. And it doesn't contain the negative numbers, okay? So there are things that aren't in that set. There are numbers not in that set, even though it's got an infinite number of numbers.

### 13m

Similarly, we're going to get to here, this idea that although there's an infinite number of different logically possible, uh, of possible environments that this, that can be rendered by this computer, uh, as a virtual reality generator, it won't contain everything that's, that is logically possible. It won't contain everything that's logically possible. So that's the setup. David goes on to say, quote, Now, let us imagine this infinite set of possible programs arranged in an infinitely long list and numbered, program 1, program 2, and so on. They could, for instance, be arranged in alphabetical order with respect to the set of numbers. They could be arranged in alphabetical order with respect to the set of numbers. They could be arranged in alphabetical order with respect to the set of numbers. Because each program generates an environment, this list can also be regarded as a list of all the environments in the machine's repertoire. We may call them environment 1, environment 2, and so on. It could be that some of the environments are repeated in the list because two different programs might, in effect, perform the same calculations. But that will not affect the argument. What is important is that each environment in our machine's repertoire

### 14m

should appear at least once in the list. David makes a few more remarks. I'm going to, again, skip over and pick it up where he says, quote, Let me define a class of logically possible environments which I shall call can't-go-to environments. That's spelt C-A-N-T-G-O-T-U. Can't-go-to environments. Partly in honor of Cantor, Gödel, and Turing. And partly for a reason I shall explain shortly. End quote. Very clever. Clever little name there. Can't-go-to environments. Can't-go-to environments. Can't-go-to environments. Can't-go-to environments. Can't-go-to environments and due to Cantor, Gödel, and Turing. Let's keep going. Quote. They are defined as follows. For the first subjective minute, a can't-go-to environment behaves differently from environment one, generated by program one of our generator. It does not matter how it does behave, so long as it is, to the user, recognizably different from environment one.

### 15m

During the second minute, it behaves differently from environment two, though it is now allowed to resemble environment one again. During the third minute, it behaves differently from environment three and so on. Any environment that satisfies these rules, I shall call a can't-go-to environment. Now, since a can't-go-to environment does not behave exactly like environment one, it cannot be environment one. Since it does not behave exactly like environment two, it cannot be environment two. Since it is guaranteed sooner or later to behave differently from environment three, environment four, and every other environment on the list, it cannot be any of those, but that list contains all the environments that are generated by every possible program for this machine. It follows that none of the can't-go-to environments are in the machine's repertoire. The can't-go-to environments are environments that we can't go to using this virtual reality generator. End quote. Pausing there. That's the diagonal. That's a kind of diagonal argument.

### 16m

It illustrates a couple of things, that this infinitely long list that can, of programs that can render any environment at all, all the environments that are possible, limited only by the memory capacity of the computer, let's say. You've got environment one, that it can render. Maybe it looks like Earth as it is today. Environment two, maybe it is Earth as it was yesterday, and repeat for all the days in the past, and then for environments on Mars, and so on and so forth. This infinitely long list of environments that the computer, can generate based upon programs in the computer. But the ones that it can't render are infinitely greater in number. There's many, many more after all. Environment one is one such environment that can be rendered. Now all that we require is that our first can't-go-to environment differs from environment one in any way, shape, or form. But there's an infinite number of ways in which it could differ from environment one.

### 17m

So already we've got an infinite number of ways it could differ. There's an infinite number of ways it could differ from environment two, and so on and so forth. So the ones that can't be rendered, the can't-go-to environments, vastly outnumber the number of environments that can be rendered. Even though the ones that can be rendered are infinite in number. Okay, let's keep going. David writes, quote, Clearly there are enormously many can't-go-to environments because the definition leaves enormous freedom in choosing how they should behave. The only constraint being that during each minute, they should not behave in one particular way. It can be proved that for every environment in the repertoire of a given virtual reality generator, there are infinitely many can't-go-to environments that it cannot render. Nor is there much scope for extending the repertoire by using a range of different virtual reality generators. Okay, no, end quote. I won't go on and read the explanation of that. Leave that as an exercise to the reader. Instead, I'll pick it up where David writes, quote,

### 18m

Thus our hypothetical project of building a virtual reality generator, building the ultimate virtual reality generator which had been going so well, has suddenly run into a brick wall. Whatever improvements may be made in the distant future, the repertoire of the entire technology of virtual reality will never grow beyond a certain fixed set of environments. Admittedly, this set is infinitely large and very diverse by comparison with human experience prior to virtual reality technology. Nevertheless, it is only an infinitesimal fraction of the set of all logically possible environments. What would it feel like to be in a can't-go-to environment? Although the laws of physics do not permit us to be in one, it is still logically possible and so it is legitimate to ask what it would feel like. Certainly, it could give us no new sensations because a universal image generator is possible and is assumed to be part of our high-technology virtual reality generator. So a can't-go-to environment would seem mysterious to us

### 19m

only after we had experienced it and reflected on the results. It would go something like this. Suppose you are a virtual reality buff. In the distant, ultra-high technology future, you have become jaded, for it seems to you that you've already tried everything interesting. But then one day a genie appears and claims to be able to transport you to a can't-go-to environment. You are skeptical, but you agree to put the claim to the test. You are whisked away to the environment. After a few experiments, you seem to recognize it. It responds just like one of your favorite environments, which on your home virtual reality system has program number X. However, you keep experimenting and eventually during the X-th subjective minute of the experience, the environment responds in a way that is markedly different from anything that environment X would do. So you give up the idea that this is environment X. You may then notice that everything that has happened so far is also consistent with another renderable environment, environment Y. But then, during the Y-th subjective minute, you are proved wrong again.

### 20m

The characteristic of a can't-go-to environment is simply this. No matter how much you experiment, the environment will respond differently. No matter how often you guess, no matter how complex a program you contemplate as being the one that might be rendering the environment, you will always be proved wrong because no program will render it on your virtual reality generator or on any other. Sooner or later, you will have to bring the test to a close. At that point, you may well decide to concede the genie's claim. That is not to say that you could ever prove that you had been in a can't-go-to environment, for there is always an even more complex program that the genie might have been running, which would match your experiences so far. That is just the general feature of virtual reality that I have already discussed. Namely, that experience cannot prove that one is in a given environment, be it the center court at Wimbledon or an environment of the can't-go-to type." So that harks back to the previous chapter talking about not being able to confirm that you are on an

### 21m

actual rendering of the real Wimbledon. Which is to say, you can't confirm, you can only ever disconfirm, logically speaking. Moving on, David writes, quote, Anyway, there are no such genies, and no such environments. So we must conclude that physics does not allow the repertoire of a virtual reality generator to be anywhere near as large as logic alone would allow. How large can it be? Since we cannot hope to render all logically possible environments, let us consider a weaker, but ultimately more interesting, sort of universality. Let us define a universal virtual reality generator as one whose repertoire contains that of every other physically possible virtual reality generator. Can such a machine exist? It can. Thinking about futuristic devices based on computer-controlled nerve stimulation makes this obvious. In fact, almost too obvious. Such a machine could be programmed to have the characteristics of any

### 22m

rival machine. Such a machine could be programmed to have the characteristics of any rival machine. Such a machine could be programmed to have the characteristics of any rival machine. Such a machine could be programmed to have the characteristics of any rival machine. Such a machine could calculate how that machine would respond under any given program to any behavior by the user, and so could render those responses with perfect accuracy from the point of view of a given user, any given user. Pausing there, my reflection. Just perfect accuracy there. Remember, that was defined in the previous chapter, and it's basically where the user themselves is unable to distinguish. And if you're unable to distinguish X from Y, then to you, to a perfect degree of accuracy, X is equal to Y. That's all. It's just the subjective perfect accuracy. It's not perfect accuracy in sort of an objective sense, which doesn't exist. Let's keep going. Quote, I say this is almost too obvious because it contains an important assumption about what the proposed device, and more specifically its computer, could be programmed to do. Given the appropriate program, and enough time and storage media, it could calculate the output of any computation performed

### 23m

by any other computer, including the one in the rival virtual reality generator. Thus, the feasibility of a universal virtual reality generator depends on the existence of a universal computer, a single machine that can calculate anything that can be calculated. As I have said, this sort of universality was first studied not by physicists, but by mathematicians. They were trying to make precise the intuitive notion of computing or calculating or proving something in mathematics. They did not take on board the fact that mathematical calculation is a physical process. In particular, as I've explained, it is a virtual reality rendering process. So it is impossible to determine by mathematical reasoning what can or cannot be calculated mathematically. That depends entirely on the laws of physics. But instead of trying to deduce their results from physical laws, mathematicians postulated abstract models of

### 24m

computation and defined calculation and proof in terms of those models. I shall discuss this interesting mistake in chapter 10. That is how it came about that over a period of a few months in 1936, three mathematicians, Emil Post, Alonzo Church, and most importantly, Alan Turing, independently created the first abstract designs for universal computers. Just pausing there my reflection, I might just go back and just to mention that this argument here, this explanation about the fact that mathematics consists of, well, explanations, but it it requires calculations. It uses proofs and computations. And these things are completed by physical systems, whether the mathematician themselves or computers and pocket calculators and that kind of thing. So are bound necessarily by the laws of physics.

### 25m

So what is able to be proved is limited by the set of things that the laws of physics say is provable. Because you're building computers out of matter. The matter obeys laws of physics, and those laws of physics only allow certain kinds of things to be proved. The laws of physics bound what can be mathematically proved. Okay, so many mathematicians don't like that. That doesn't matter. Doesn't affect the fact that it's true. Many people don't like that. They think that somehow mathematics has to be prior to physics in some sense. Now all that said, precisely the same argument applies even more broadly to reasoning in general. You can't get outside of the laws of physics. What can be known is bounded by the laws of physics. And so, philosophy,

### 26m

philosophy, epistemology, reasoning itself is done by physical things, human beings, brains, minds, and they obey laws of physics. So it is the laws of physics that constrain the possibility of what we can think, what we can know, what we can reason. This is not a problem as such, but it's just worth keeping in view and understanding. It does come to bear on our capacity to know, but it doesn't come to bear on our capacity to solve problems that we're interested in. In particular, it's the very thing that allows us to know that problems are soluble. Problems are soluble precisely because, well, the physical structure of our brain, what it's able... to do uniquely is generate explanations, which can be in one-to-one correspondence with

### 27m

the rest of physical reality. That's what the laws of physics allow. The laws of physics provide constraints, but allow for that, and therefore allow for the solving in principle of any possible problem we could encounter. Problems are soluble. And David's going to essentially get to that in this chapter. But I think one reason I'm also saying that is that philosophers who are sometimes disconnected to some extent from physics fail to take this into account and think that physics can be irrelevant to what they're doing, but it's not. Not utterly irrelevant. It's not to say that everything reduces to physics. I'm not being reductionist in this sense. Or that the philosopher needs to refer to what's going on in physics. I'm not being reductionist in this sense. In physics now and again. But the reasoning itself, it has to be understood, is itself bounded by what the laws of physics permit us to reason about. And, you know, so if you're

### 28m

trying to, you know, the common area here, really, I guess I'm circling, is prophecy. That philosophers, epistemologists, others who don't take this on board fully, who think that there must be a mechanism, whether by induction or something else, that allows them to forecast the future perfectly accurately. But that is in contravention to laws of physics. It's that kind of thing that, importantly, is constrained by laws of physics. Laws of physics set a bound on what is knowable. And one thing that's not knowable is the creation of knowledge. Knowledge creation. The future cannot be known with perfect fidelity. Also because of laws of physics, as well as the fact that people create explanatory knowledge, which changes the future in ways that cannot be known ahead of time. Okay, that's a major theme of Beginning of Infinity, a theme throughout TopCast as well. So I'll just point to earlier work on

### 29m

that kind of stuff, rather than going down the road of making that argument again. But just to say that a knowledge of this kind of physics can help the philosopher and the epistemologist, the people who are interested in knowledge, rather than being utterly disconnected from things. And I think that's where some philosophers go wrong, especially when they fall into pessimism. It can be because of this. Okay, back to the book. We're talking about how Emil Post, Alonzo Church, and Alan Turing, most importantly, created the first abstract designs for universal computers. Okay, so abstract designs, important to know. Not a physical design, abstract mathematical theory of the computer, without being concerned about the physical laws that actually control these things. David Wright's on this. Each of them conjectured that his model of computation did indeed correctly formalize the traditional intuitive notion of mathematical computation. Consequently, each of them also

### 30m

conjectured that his model was equivalent to, had the same repertoire as, any other reasonable formalization of the same intuition. This is now known as the Church-Turing conjecture. Turing's model of computation, and his conception of the nature of the problem he was solving, was the closest to being physical. The Turing machine was abstracted from the idea of a paper tape divided into squares with one of a finite number of easily distinguishable symbols written on each square. Computation was performed by examining one square at a time, moving the tape backwards or forwards, and erasing or writing one of the symbols according to simple, unambiguous rules. Pausing there, my reflection. This is one of the most jarring insights that goes, unsaid, untaught, unlearned, I think, these days. Unless one takes on a pure mathematics course,

### 31m

takes an interest in this kind of thing, goes into computer science, whatever. That no matter how diverse this technology of computers becomes, how ubiquitous it becomes, that all of it can be modeled. Modulo what David is about to say, and the insights that David brings with quantum computation, all that other stuff. But it can be modeled. By, reduced to, the action of reading an infinitely, well, not infinite, but, you know, a very long tape divided into squares with symbols written on it. That's what computers do. It doesn't matter how complicated the program. It could be running a word processor. It could be simulating the collision of galaxies. It could be running a computer game. It could be, you know, Facebook or Twitter or a flight simulator. Whatever the program is, whatever the thing is that the computer is, it can be modeled. It can be modeled. It can be modeled. It can be modeled. It can be modeled. It can be modeled. It can be modeled. It can be modeled. It can be modeled. It can be modeled. It can be modeled. It can be modeled. It can be modeled. It's based upon code, a program. And that itself can be represented as

### 32m

symbols of zeros and ones on a long strip of paper. Remarkable. Absolutely remarkable. And when you get into the details of this, how this in principle could be done for any program is perhaps jarring to people. That a complicated computer program could reduce to such a simple thing, such a simple idea. And this is the first model of computation, which predated the existence of any actual computer that had been built, any electronic computer. Let's keep going. And David writes, quote, Turing proved that one particular computer of this type, the universal Turing machine, had the combined repertoire of all other Turing machines. He conjectured that this repertoire consisted precisely of every function that would naturally be regarded as computable. He meant computable by mathematicians. But mathematicians are rather untypical physical objects. Why should

### 33m

we assume that rendering them in the act of performing calculations is the ultimate in computational tasks? It turns out that it is not. As I shall explain in chapter nine, quantum computers can perform computations of which no human mathematician will ever, even in principle, be capable. Pausing there, my reflection. Now, why should there be things that a human mathematician cannot, even in principle, calculate? Does this violate the universality of the human mind? It doesn't. Why? Well, because calculation is not explanation. Now, quantum computers harness something called entanglement and interference phenomena. I go to top casts that are about the multiverse to go into that or to read sections of the fabric of reality. I go to the universality or the beginning of infinity to understand or have more insight into entanglement and interference phenomena. But anyway, quantum computers use this. But this is not how brains,

### 34m

presumably, do what they do. That's not how they do their computations. So although a person cannot calculate what a quantum computer can, you know, a person can't quickly do the prime factorization of a 15-digit number or calculate the position, let's say, of electrons in a uranium atom. This does not prevent us from understanding those things and what is going on there and using technology to do it. We can still understand it. We can still explain those things, that phenomena. There is a difference between calculation, which in physics allows, you know, some precise prediction and understanding the explanation that allows for that prediction to be made. We're still universal. Human beings are people. People are universal. We're universal explainers, not universal calculators. Indeed, I don't think there can be a universal calculator. After all, all we need to do is to just think of a number large enough whose prime factorization could never be done, even in the multiverse, no matter how much

### 35m

time you gave it. Whatever number that is, I don't know, 10 to the power of 10 to the power of a million to the power of seven or something. I don't know. There must be some number out there which is just so large that the prime factorization would just take, you know, longer than the life of the universe. But maybe the universe goes on forever. Maybe if the universe is eternal and this computer lasted forever and had an infinite amount of energy, maybe then you could have this universal calculator. But put aside that, there are non-computable functions, as Turing and particular Gödel prove. There are these non-computable things anyway. Okay, let's go back to the book. Quote, It is implicit in Turing's work that he expected what, would naturally be regarded as computable, to be also what could, at least in principle, be computed in nature. This expectation is tantamount to a stronger, physical version of the Church-Turing conjecture. The mathematician Roger Penrose has suggested that it should be

### 36m

called the Turing principle. The Turing principle for abstract computers simulating physical objects. There exists an abstract universal computer whose repertoire includes any computation that any physically possible computer can compute. The Turing principle for abstract computers includes any possible object can perform. So that's the Turing principle, David goes on to say. Turing believed that the universal computer in question was the universal Turing machine. To take account of the wider repertoire of quantum computers, I have stated the principle in a form that does not specify which particular abstract computer does the job. Pausing there my reflection. So this is David's addition to Turing's work. The generalization of what Turing started, Turing's principle, David proved, and which laid the foundations for quantum computation, that there is such a physical object that can be constructed that is able to do the computations

of anything, of any computable thing can be computed by this particular thing. And that includes anything made of matter, obeying laws of physics, is going to be, its behavior is going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be computable. It goes on to say, quote, The proof I have given of the existence of can't-go-to environments is essentially due to Turing. As I said, he was not thinking explicitly in terms of virtual reality, but in an environment that can be rendered, does correspond to a class of mathematical questions whose answers can be calculated. Those questions are computable. The remainder, the questions for which there is no way of calculating the answer, are called non-computable. If a question is non-computable, that does not mean that it has no answer, or that its answer is in any sense ill-defined or ambiguous. On the contrary, it means that it definitely has an answer, it is just that there physically is no way, even in principle, of obtaining that answer, or more precisely,

### 38m

since one could always make a lucky unverifiable guess, of proving that is the answer. For example, a prime pair is a pair of prime numbers whose difference is 2, such as 3 and 5, or 11 and 13. Mathematicians have tried, in vain, to answer the question whether there are infinitely many such pairs, or only a finite number of them. It is not even known whether this question is computable. Let us suppose that it is not. That is to say that no one and no computer can ever produce a proof either that there are only finitely many prime pairs, or that there are infinitely many. Even so, the question does have an answer. One can say with certainty that either there is a highest prime pair, or there are infinitely many prime pairs. There is no third possibility. The question remains well defined, even though we may never know the answer. In virtual reality terms, no physically possible virtual reality generator

### 39m

can render an environment in which answers to non-computable questions are provided to the user on demand. Such environments are of the can't-go-to type. And conversely, every can't-go-to environment corresponds to a class of mathematical questions. What would happen next in an environment defined in such and such a way? The answer is the question itself, which it is physically possible to answer. Although non-computable questions are infinitely more numerous than computable ones, they tend to be more esoteric. That is no accident. It is because the parts of mathematics that we tend to consider the least esoteric are those we see reflected in the behavior of physical objects in familiar situations. In such cases, we can often use those physical objects to answer questions about the corresponding mathematical relationships. For example, we can count on our fingers because the physics of fingers in computer science is a little bit more difficult. fingers naturally mimics the arithmetic of the whole numbers from zero to ten pausing there my reflection yeah so um pure mathematics doesn't need to concern itself about whether it applies

### 40m

to physical stuff they can pure mathematicians can consider pure abstractions okay the things that aren't made out of material at all and don't obey the laws of physics even though what can be known is constrained by the laws of physics that that's a separate issue quite a separate issue the the constraints placed on mathematics by the laws of physics aren't constraints that prevent mathematics from delving into non-physical stuff indeed pure mathematics is largely about non-physical stuff there's a there's a great youtube video of richard feinman talking about mathematics and physics the relationship between them and the relationship between the mathematicians and the physicists in particular it's almost like a stand-up routine that the man was just so engaging so entertaining and so funny uh when he talks about certain things and that that particular one i'll try and remember to provide a link in the description to this video to that one um i can't put a clip here i'd like to be able to put a clip here but it seems when i do that they they take down the

### 41m

entire video and it's such a hassle so i have to avoid putting clips in these days but in it you know like feinman's basically saying you're like your physicist is sort of interested in specific cases he's not interested in general cases you know he he goes along to the mathematician and he says i'm interested in you know like the the laws of gravity for example in in three-dimensional space i just need the three-dimensional space and the mathematician pure mathematician will say well for an n-dimensional space here are the theorems that follow and the physicist will say i'm not interested in n dimensions i'm not interested in just the arbitrary you know sort of force i'm not interested in arbitrary spaces of n dimensions i'm interested in a specific case and the pure mathematician will say well just substitute n equals three then and then of course feinman goes on to say something like um then of course the physicist has to go crawling back to the pure mathematician at some point and say you know you're talking about those n-dimensional spaces um what about the case of n equals four

### 42m

sometimes these the general case turns out to be very useful for the for the physicist and there is this cross-pollination that happens between physics and mathematics of course what what is done in in math in pure mathematics sometimes is to be utterly irrelevant and you know um i've mentioned before the case of g.h hardy and a mathematician's apology uh he wrote this book about you know meeting romanujan another famous mathematician and hardy said hardy said of his own work that he didn't think it would ever have any applications to anything ever and he was quite proud of it he regarded as more being like art okay just to just it's exploring the space of mathematics for for its own sake but in fact his own work i think it went on went on to be used in electrical engineering and you know it had had applications anyway it had proper applications later on and you know that's the unpredictability of the growth of knowledge and it can happen in the other direction as well you know physicists can can do work in physics which then goes on to have a bearing on

### 43m

what happens in mathematics i think you know things like chaos theory you know there's first investigated by physicists about how seemingly purely deterministic systems being you know simple laws can actually become chaotic even if you assume that the classical laws of physics the perfectly deterministic laws of physics they can lead to these extremely complex behavior a double pendulum is one such thing which has this interestingly chaotic behavior so that that comes from physics and goes into um pure mathematics and the pure mathematicians can explore that kind of thing but yes if you want to laugh um definitely look up um feinman talking about mathematics and and physics let's keep going david writes quote of the three very different abstract computers defined by turing church and post were soon proved to be identical so have the repertoires of all abstract models of mathematical computation that have since been proposed this is deemed to lend support to the church turing conjecture

### 44m

and to the universality of the universal turing machine however the computing power of abstract machines has no bearing on what is computable in reality pausing there my reflection yes so here this is the genius of david deutsch this is where it comes in right i mean yeah if you regard turing as a genius for the insight about all of this computation stuff which he certainly was then so is this insight by david okay it may seem simple in retrospect you know like so much of science just seems simple like why couldn't i think of that well because you're not thinking about this particular problem all the time you could any of us could but we didn't it's the people that uh passionately and curious and interested in these particular problems and and push the frontier of science in this case physics and computation forward this this whole idea that um that thinking about computation as actually being physical and not merely an abstract thing it takes insight

### 45m

questioning assumptions and that can be hard which assumptions do you question and once you question those assumptions what do you replace them with what what's better it's no point just saying oh let's assume that's false well then what are you going to put in its place if nothing does it lead to something better or not even even recognizing noticing in the first place that something is an assumption at all is hard computation is assumed to be abstract and not physical oh is it yeah that that's an assumption and i guess a lot of the mathematicians who are doing this didn't realize the assumptions they were making you know who notices that kind of thing what is the consequence of that it's like oh physics is not an assumption it's not an assumption it's not an assumption it's not an assumption it's not an assumption it's not an assumption it's not an assumption it's not an assumption about dynamical laws you know you plug in the initial conditions and you calculate what goes on next but that's an assumption as well what if we relaxed that assumption and considered something deeper about what is possible and impossible why would we ever question the very foundations of

### 46m

physics who would ever do that well these things take creative leaps don't they and those creative leaps can be the hard part you have to sit down and you have to be creative and you have to think about the these things. They're hard and yet not hard. You know, like they're hard and once someone's done it, you can look back and you go, oh, you know, how could it have been otherwise? It's that kind of thing. But it's beforehand, before the creative act has taken place that, you know, people are struggling to make the progress. And yet it always seems in retrospect, oh, that was so simple. I could have done that. Yeah, you could have. But you weren't focused on that problem, were you? And yet this is the kind of thing that anyone interested in progress needs to strive for. It's not to say, well, you just go around assuming everything is false and then you're done, question everything and then you're done. No, you need an alternative. This is the hard part. You need to, yeah, take what is known now, regarded as the best explanation now, figure out what could

### 47m

possibly be false about it and replace that with something better. Something that is going to have consequences that you can investigate and pursue or that others can't. Perhaps. And then you might have a whole new field of physics, let's say. You might have a whole field of quantum computation, say. Okay, let's keep going. David Wright's quote. The scope of virtual reality and its wider implications for the comprehensibility of nature and other aspects of the fabric of reality depends on whether the relevant computers are physically realizable. In particular, any genuine universal computer must itself be physically realizable. This leads to a strong, strong, strong, strong, strong, strong, strong, version of the Turing Principle. The Turing Principle for physical computers simulating each other. It is possible to build a universal computer, a machine that can be programmed to perform any computation that any other physical object can perform. It follows that if a universal

### 48m

image generator were controlled by a universal computer, the resulting machine would be a universal virtual reality generator. In other words, the following principle also holds. The Turing Principle. It is possible to build a virtual reality generator whose repertoire includes that of every other physically possible virtual reality generator. Now, any environment can be rendered by a virtual reality generator of some sort. For instance, one could always regard a copy of that very environment as a virtual reality generator with perhaps a very small repertoire. So it also follows from this version of the Turing Principle that any physically possible environment can be rendered by the universal computer. The Turing Principle. It is possible to build a virtual reality generator based on a universal virtual reality generator. Hence, to express the very strong self-similarity that exists in the structure of reality, embracing not only computations but all physical processes, the Turing Principle

### 49m

can be stated in this all-embracing form. The Turing Principle. It is possible to build a virtual reality generator whose repertoire includes every physically possible environment. This is the strongest form of the Turing Principle. not only tells us that various parts of reality can resemble one another it tells us that a single physical object buildable once and for all apart from maintenance and a supply of additional memory when needed can perform with unlimited accuracy the task of describing or mimicking any other part of the multiverse this set of all behaviors and responses that one object exactly mirrors the set of all behaviors and responses of all other physically possible objects and processes the set of all behaviors and responses of that one object exactly mirrors the set of all behaviors and responses of all other physically possible objects and processes pausing there my reflection so this

### 50m

is the basis of quantum computation this says that you can build this thing this computer quantum computer which so long as you have the program so long as you know what to feed into this computer it can represent that in the environment it can represent that world in particular if you have a theory of physics then you can program it in you can model the the rest of physical reality and and it also implies the existence of people who can understand because they also are rendering these environments with their models of science that this can be done too that that that this is the comprehensibility of physical reality as well well it allows for the comprehensibility of physical reality as well let's go on david writes on this exact point david goes on right quote

### 51m

this is just the sort of self similarity that is necessary if according to the hope i expressed in chapter one the fabric of reality is to be truly unified and comprehensible if the laws of physics as they apply to any physical object or process are to be comprehensible they must be capable of being embodied in another physical object the noah pausing there my reflection so that's the universal explainer now this particular passage is where i say david's just dropping insight bombs it's just so much of the beginning of infinity yet to come even stuff of the science of canon can't the constructor theory and it's just deep deep stuff so i'll go on okay and then i'm going to go back and i'm going to read some of this again to emphasis it's important david writes quote it is also necessary that processes capable of creating such knowledge be physically possible such processes are called science science depends

### 52m

on experimental testing which means physically rendering a law's predictions and comparing it with a rendering of reality end quote so we've moved from the existence of the universal computer the turing principle the idea that noah's are able to come to a an understanding of physical reality that's entailed within this and also that science therefore is possible and physically testing theories is possible this is all coming from the same thing now i apologize if anyone feels patronized that i'm just laboring belaboring the point but it's just um um um for anyone who's new to this the the these can be deep insights and it's one reason why because of the density of of of consequences that flow from and david pursues these these consequences but the density of them

### 53m

the number of them the depth of them means that sometimes the world view is difficult to convey and let's say a few tweets haha haha It's merely their predictive content to be capable of being rendered in virtual reality end quote so there we have uh... david in the fabric of reality again you know laying laying out the the the the the the deep themes of the beginning of infinity

### 54m

and and again the idea of the noah here okay then the purpose of science abstract laws themselves being explained not merely being about their predictive content being able to explain them not merely being about their predictive content being able to explain them but also being able to predict stuff instrumentalism is false david goes on this is a tall order but reality does meet it that is to say the laws of physics meet it the laws of physics by conforming to the turing principle make it physically possible for those same laws to become known to physical objects thus the laws of physics may be said to mandate their own comprehensibility end quote so it's that kind of passage that sets the book apart from other books haha it is not merely that the science it's philosophical exploration of these ideas and hence provides uh... whole worldview thinking about reality there he is coherent as far as we can tell

### 55m

it's the deepest one we can tell providing for cosmic significance of people and comprehensibility all of that cosmos and it goes on with more and more influence in this real more insight bombs but really i i just have to without interruption without interruption go go back and and just read through that okay because david's talking about self-similarity what is this self-similarity self-similarity is well and i talk about this in my nexus video the idea here is that in a person's mind they represent the rest of physical reality there's a self-similarity there's relationships between ideas you have in your mind that correspond to some degree of accuracy with physical reality that's what self-similarity is and so that that connection between us and the cosmos or all of reality rather you know

### 56m

every single thing that can be known makes us unique and important so let's just go go through and read that again, because it is just one of the reasons why this is one of my favorite chapters. It's the wheelhouse of David Deutsch. It underscores the worldview presented to us in both of his books hitherto. This optimistic, all-encompassing way in which these findings, like the Turing principle, allow for comprehensibility, infinite progress, solving of problems. Let's just read it again. Let's just read it again and enjoy it without my interruption. Quote, this is just the sort of self-similarity that is necessary if, according to the hope I expressed in chapter one, the fabric of reality is to be truly unified and comprehensible. If the laws of physics as they apply to any physical object or process are to be comprehensible, they must be capable of being embodied in another physical object, the knower.

### 57m

It is also necessary that processes capable of creating such knowledge be physically possible. Such processes are called science. Science depends on experimental testing, which means physically rendering a law's predictions and comparing it with a rendering of reality. It also depends on explanation, and that requires the abstract laws themselves, not merely their predictive content, to be capable of being rendered in virtual reality. This is a tall order, but reality does meet it. That is to say, the laws of physics meet it. The laws of physics, by conforming to the Turing principle, make it physically possible for those same laws to become known to physicists. Thus, the laws of physics may be said to mandate their own comprehensibility. Amazing stuff. The scientific view of the deep importance of human beings as people, the scientific view, the rejection of parochialism and the principle of mediocrity,

### 58m

and pessimism about people as a chemical scum. That's all there. That we are. Unique. And, in some sense, written into the laws of physics. Okay, let's keep going. David Wright's quote. Since building a universal virtual reality generator is physically possible, it must actually be built in some universes. A caveat is necessary here. As I explained in Chapter 3, we can normally define a physically possible process as one that actually occurs somewhere in the multiverse. But strictly speaking, a universal virtual reality generator is a limiting case that requires arbitrarily. So what we mean by saying that it is physically possible is that virtual reality generators would repertoise arbitrarily close to the set of all physically possible environments exist in the multiverse. Similarly, since the laws of physics are capable of being rendered, they are rendered somewhere. Thus, it follows from the Turing principle in the strong form for which I have argued that the laws of physics do not merely mandate their own comprehensibility

### 59m

in some abstract sense. Comprehensibility by abstract sense is not the only thing that is possible. Comprehensibility by abstract sense is not the only thing that is possible. Comprehensibility by abstract sense is not the only thing that is possible. Comprehensibility by abstract sense is not the only thing that is possible. Comprehensibility by abstract sense is not the only thing that is possible. Comprehensibility by abstract sense is not the only thing that is possible. Scientists, as it were, they imply the physical existence, somewhere in the multiverse, of entities that understand them arbitrarily well. I shall discuss this implication further in later chapters. Pausing there, just my reflection. Yes, so, when it says there, just be aware. Now, I'm not speaking, this is me talking, this is not David talking. I could be wrong. Mistake's my own. This could be one of them that I'm about to make. But my understanding of that there is, when he says they imply the physical existence, somewhere in the multiverse of entities that understand them arbitrarily well. He's not saying that here right now, at the same time as us, somewhere there are aliens that exist that understand them arbitrarily well. It's that we could be those entities. If we're not, then someone else will be. Some other species will be. But we could be that species. We could be those entities that understand the physical laws arbitrarily well.

### 1h 0m

In other words, people are mandated by the laws of physics. If they're possible, they exist somewhere. Well, here we are. Here we are. Now, it could be the case that a great catastrophe wipes us out. That the Bostroms and Reeses and various other intellectuals who think that civilization could come to an end. We all think it could come to an end, but they tend to be putting their eggs into that basket. Civilization crumbling. They could be right. And if they are right, then we won't be the ones that go on to understand the physical laws arbitrarily well. But other people will. So that's my understanding of that. We could be the ones. I think we will be. I think we will be. It appears to be the case. There needs to be a history of optimism written that things are getting better.

### 1h 1m

Not irrevocably. Not necessarily. But there are explanations that go into allowing for the dynamic society which we are occupying right now. And the robustness and the resilience of this society is growing, not diminishing. Of course, hyperbole and pessimism is increasing to some extent in some places. But optimism is increasing in other places as well. So in the West, sometimes we end up having a... a bit of a blinkered view. Because our intellectuals have a certain culture at the moment. I think it's transient. I think that, you know, there'll be a resurgence of optimism. People are going to get bored. They're going to get bored with the constant pessimism. The constant way in which people are... Human beings talk down human beings. Talk up the environment. This can't last. This can't last.

### 1h 2m

I'm hopeful. Okay, let's keep going. Don't want to get too off track. David writes, quote, Now I return to the question I posed in the previous chapter. Namely, whether if we only had a virtual reality rendering based on the wrong laws of physics to learn from, we should expect to learn the wrong laws. The first thing to stress is that we do have only virtual reality based on the wrong laws to learn from. As I've said, all our external experiences are of virtual reality generated by our own brains. And since our concepts and theories whether inborn or learned are never perfect, all our renderings are indeed inaccurate. That is to say, they give us the experience of an environment that is significantly different from the environment that we are really in. Mirages and other optical illusions are examples of this. Another is that we experience the Earth to be at rest beneath our feet despite its rapid and complex motion in reality. Another is that we experience a single universe and a single instance of our unconscious selves at a time, while in reality there are many.

### 1h 3m

But these inaccurate and misleading experiences provide no answer to the question, argument against scientific reasoning. On the contrary, such deficiencies are its very starting point. Pausing there, my reflection. Yes, so this is the refutation of empiricism. Our senses don't provide us with accurate information. We need science. Science is about explaining what we see in terms of what we don't see. It's the seen in terms of the unseen. My desk here, made of wood, solid, continuous matter. It feels like, feels nice and smooth. We know it's bumpy atoms. Can't see the atoms. My senses are not going to be able to tell me that. But we have theories, and we had theories of atoms before we had scanning electron microscopes that could produce images for us of those atoms. No image is possible, no way of seeing what is going on in the core of the Sun. The core of the Sun is not directly observable. We can see the surface.

### 1h 4m

But we know what's going on there. We know what's going on there because of our explanations. Big bang, no one's going to be there to observe it. No one was there to observe it. But we know what happened. No one's going to see a dinosaur. Almost everything in science is like this. We don't see the stuff that really explains what we do see. Whether because it's too small, too vast, too far back in time, so on and so forth. Science is about the seen in terms of the unseen. We get an inaccurate experience of reality. Our experience is virtual reality. Real reality, we can come to approximate that more and more over time, more and more closely over time. And we do. But still, I mean, we're just barely scratching the surface, as the beginning of infinity emphasizes. We're always at the beginning of infinity.

### 1h 5m

We're always just scratching the surface. Our virtual reality rendering, understanding improves over time. That's science. That's that kind of virtual reality. And then there's the virtual reality of us just being minds running on brains in the darkness of our skulls. That's where we really are. But we are connected to the rest of physical reality via these imperfect sense-gathering things, eyes and ears and hands and so on. Okay, let's keep going. David Wright's quote. We are embarked upon solving problems about physical reality. If it turns out that all this time we have merely been studying the programming of a cosmic planetarium, then that would merely mean that we have been studying a smaller portion of reality than we thought. So what? Such things have happened many times in the history of science, as our horizons have expanded beyond the Earth to include the solar system, our galaxy, other galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and so on, and of course, parallel universes. Another such broadening of reality, something may happen tomorrow.

### 1h 6m

Indeed, it may happen according to any one of an infinity of possible theories, or it may never happen. Logically, we must concede to solipsism and related doctrines that the reality we are learning about might be an unrepresentative portion of a larger inaccessible or incomprehensible structure. But the general refutation I have given of such doctrines shows that it is irrational to build upon that possibility. Following Occam, we shall entertain such theories when and only when they provide better explanations, then simple, rival theories. Pausing there, my reflection. Yeah, exactly. Reality, realism rather, realism, allows for progress to be made, problems to be solved. But the opposite, solipsism, well, how do you build on that? What follows? Okay, it's all a dream. Okay, what follows? If what follows, Gerard and Lenny Eyre makes this problem, if what follows is, well, science still works in the same way it would under realism, you've just got an unnecessary assumption, don't you? You know, realism just works,

### 1h 7m

but let's add on top of that, but it's all a dream. Why not just do away with the, but it's all a dream, but it's all a simulation, and just get on with science, because that's the most parsimonious way of working. Assume things are real. David goes on to write, quote, However, there is a question we can still ask. Suppose that someone were imprisoned in a small, unrepresentative portion of our own reality, for instance, inside a universal virtual reality generator that was programmed with the wrong laws of physics. What could such prisoners learn about our external reality? At first sight, it seems impossible that they could discover anything at all about it. It may seem that the most they could discover would be the laws of operation, i.e., the program of the computer that operated their prison. But that is not so. Again, we must bear in mind that if the prisoners are scientists, they will be seeking explanations as well as predictions. In other words,

### 1h 8m

they will not be content with merely knowing the program that operates their prison. They will want to explain the origin and attributes of the various entities, including themselves, that they observe in the reality they inhabit. But in most virtual reality environments, no such explanation exists, for the rendered objects do not originate there, but have been designed in the external reality. Suppose that you are playing a virtual reality video game. For the sake of simplicity, suppose that the game is essentially chess, a first-person perspective version, perhaps, in which you adopt the persona of the king. You will use the normal methods of science to discover this environment's laws of physics and their emergent consequences. You will learn that checkmate and stalemate are physically possible events, i.e., possible under your best understanding of how the environment works. But that a position with nine white pawns is not physically possible. Once you had understood the laws sufficiently well, you would notice that the chessboard is too simple an object to have, for instance, thoughts,

### 1h 9m

and consequently, that your own thought processes cannot be governed by the laws of chess alone. Similarly, you could tell that during any number of games of chess, the pieces can never evolve into self-reproducing configurations, and if life cannot evolve on the chessboard, far less can intelligence evolve. Therefore, you would also infer that your own thought processes could not have originated in the universe in which you found yourself. So even if you had lived within the rendered environment all your life and did not have your own memories of the outside world to account for as well, your knowledge would not be confined to that environment. You would know that even though the universe seemed to have a certain layout and obey certain laws, there must be a wider universe outside it obeying different laws of physics, and you could even guess some of the ways in which those wider laws would have to be different from. Arthur C. Clarke once remarked that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

### 1h 10m

This is true, but slightly misleading. It is stated from the point of view of a pre-scientific thinker, which is the wrong way around. The fact is that to anyone who understands what virtual reality is, even genuine magic would be indistinguishable from technology, for there is no room for magic in a comprehensible reality. Anything that seems incomprehensible is regarded by science merely as evidence there is something we have not yet understood, be it a conjuring trick, advanced technology, or a new law of physics. Pausing there, just, um, that seems like a tweetable quote, doesn't it? I'll read it again. Anything that seems incomprehensible is regarded by science merely as evidence that there is something we have not yet understood, be it a conjuring trick, advanced technology, or a new law of physics. And he goes on to say, Reasoning from the premise that one's own existence is called anthropic reasoning. Although it has some applicability in cosmology, it usually has to be supplemented by

### 1h 11m

substantive assumptions about the nature of one's self before it yields definite conclusions. But anthropic reasoning is not the only way in which the inmates of our hypothetical virtual reality prison could gain knowledge of an outside world. Any of their evolving explanations of their narrow world could, at the drop of a hat, reach into an outside world, an outside reality. For instance, the very rules of chess contain what a thoughtful player may realise is fossil evidence of those rules having had an evolutionary history. There are exceptional moves such as casting and capturing en passant, which increase the complexity of the rules but improve the game. In explaining that complexity, one justifiably concludes that the rules of chess were not always as they are now. In the Popperian scheme of things, explanations always lead to new problems, which in turn require further explanations. If the prisoners fail, after a while, to improve upon their existing explanations, they may of course give up,

### 1h 12m

perhaps falsely concluding that there are no explanations available. But if they do not give up, they will be thinking about those aspects of their environment that seem inadequately explained. Thus, if the high technology jailers wanted to be confident that their rendered environment would forever fool their prisoners into thinking there is no outside world, they would have their work cut out for them. The longer they wanted the illusion to last, the more ingenious the program would have to be. It is not enough that the inmates be prevented from observing the outside. The rendered environment would also have to be such that no explanations of anything inside would ever require one to postulate an outside. The environment, in other words, would have to be self-contained as regards explanations. But I doubt that any part of reality, short of the whole thing, has that property. End quote. End of the chapter. Long one today, but as I think, I hope you will agree,

### 1h 13m

this just is so dense and deep and sort of has feelers into the rest of the book and the beginning of infinity and the world view as I say. This way of understanding the place of human beings and people in the cosmic scheme of things, how it is that we can go about creating an infinite stream of solutions to the problems that we encounter via creating knowledge and there is the bounds imposed by the laws of physics are there and they are real but they don't prevent us from making infinite progress. Which is what optimism is all about. But because this has been a long one, I won't have a long outro today. Instead I will just say, until next time, bye bye. Subtitles by the Amara.org community
