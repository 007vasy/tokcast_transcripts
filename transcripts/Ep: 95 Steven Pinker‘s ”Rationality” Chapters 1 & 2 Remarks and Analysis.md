Welcome to TopCast and for a special episode and probably what will become a special series on Steven Pinker's new book, Rationality. Now, I didn't really plan on making a series about this. It's only because, well, it's been getting a lot of attention recently. Steven Pinker's been doing lots of interviews and I know that Steven Pinker happens to be a great admirer of the beginning of infinity as well as David Deutsch himself. And so I thought it'd be interesting to go through his book on Rationality because the chapters really do cross over with so much of what I've discussed here on TopCast. Not only is the book called Rationality and Steven Pinker's going to have a particular take on what that concept is all about,

### 1m

but, well, let's run through what the chapter titles are and you can see why I'd be drawn to it. Chapter 1 is called How Rational an Animal. Chapter 2, Rationality and Irrationality. Chapter 3, Logic and Critical Thinking. Chapter 4, Probability and Randomness. Chapter 5, Beliefs and Evidence. In brackets, Bayesian Reasoning. Chapter 6, Risk and Reward, Rational Choice. Chapter 7, Hits and False Alarms. Chapter 8, The Self and Others, which is about game theory. Chapter 9, Correlation and Causation. Chapter 10, What's Wrong with People? Chapter 11, Why Rationality Matters. Now, Steven Pinker will be familiar to many of you. For those who are unfamiliar, he's a Harvard cognitive scientist. His original training is in, his original training, Wikipedia tells me, is in psychology.

### 2m

He's got a bachelor's and a PhD in that area. But he's the author of many popular science books. My favourite of those, many of them are in the vein of The Beginning of Infinity. And my favourite one of his recent ones is called The Better Angels of Our Nature, which is basically about how progress has indeed been occurring over the last few millennia, centuries especially. And it appears to be increasing in the rapidity with which it improves society. And so I have no disagreement with him on any of those things. And so a book like Better Angels of Our Nature, which explains all of the trends that have been going on, technological, scientific, moral, that have been happening somewhat relentlessly, if not inevitably, we don't say that it's inevitable, but it has been occurring. And that demands an explanation. An explanation, which I would argue, is quite well articulated in the work of David Deutsch in The Beginning of Infinity.

### 3m

But it's good to have other optimists out there pointing out that indeed things are getting better. It seems to be a minority opinion these days, despite the clarity with which we can see and analyse these trends of improvement. So Steven Pinker is definitely on our side, so to speak. He stands against the pessimists, at least to some extent. And so it's good to have a prominent ally like him. And certainly, as I say, he's been inspired by David Deutsch. He's praised publicly David Deutsch and his work on a number of occasions. In particular, one of his other more recent works called Enlightenment Now. He quotes David Deutsch and The Beginning of Infinity quite heavily. Okay, top five science or psychology books. The book that I really enjoyed, partly because it resonated with Enlightenment Now, but from a different angle, is David Deutsch's book The Beginning of Infinity. Deutsch is a theoretical physicist. And this was a book also on progress, also on the Enlightenment.

### 4m

But unlike what I did, which was to plot graphs on life spans going up, death and disease going down, and so on, he reasons really from first principles. How can we understand the universe? How is explanation possible? What drives science? How does the human mind stretch itself to do science? And it's a profound, weighty book. But not filled with jargon or too much technical detail. But also in Enlightenment Now, he does quote the Humanist Manifesto Part 3 from 2003. And he quotes the part, and I'll just read it, where it says, Knowledge of the world is derived by observation, experimentation and rational analysis. That's from the Humanist Manifesto. Now, of course, if you're familiar with the work of David Deutsch, your ears will prick up on that word, derived. And I'm highlighting it now because having read through the book, Rationality,

### 5m

very quickly I read through it. I've got it in triplicate. I've got it there in paperback. I've got it on my Kindle, which is where I'll be reading from today. And I've got it on audiobook as well. That kind of helps me get through books like this much more quickly than I otherwise might. But when I hear words like that, and Pinker holds that up as being a sort of maxim, by which we can judge rationality or not, knowledge of the world being derived by observation, et cetera, it makes me think, well, to be generous, maybe he just thinks that the word derived means created. So knowledge of the world is created through observation in some way, in some method, without judging what that method might be. In an ungenerous mood, we might say, well, he's just falling back on empiricism. And I think as we move through rationality, we'll see that there is, there is a deeply empiricist vein in the philosophy that Steven Pinker is using in order to explain what rationality is. And so there will be some quibbles that I will have at various points

### 6m

about the extent to which Steven Pinker really understands how knowledge is not only created, but how we can come to understand or obtain objective knowledge. I don't know that he appreciates what people like, let's say, Karl Popper, have explained how it is that knowledge is generated at all, and what knowledge, more broadly speaking, might amount to. And we're going to see some, well, what I would plainly call errors in epistemology early on. All of that said, I still recommend the book. I think that if you are after a good summary, or if you've never been able to afford, through expense or through distance or through opportunity, to be able to go to one of these top American universities, and take on a course like Critical Thinking or Rationality, taught by an excellent academic like Steven Pinker, then reading this book would be an excellent substitute.

### 7m

Now, I'm not going to do a complete series of this book, as I've done for those other books that I discuss. I'm going to do about two chapters at a time, more or less. He does say that, and quote from the preface of the book, Pinker wrote, quote, This book grew out of a course I taught at Harvard, explored the nature of rationality, and the puzzle of why it seems to be so scarce, end quote. And as I read it, I thought, yes indeed. It reads like a series of university lectures, extremely well written. And of course it's going to be well written, because Steven Pinker wrote a book on how to write well. And he specialises in linguistics and writing. So I can certainly recommend this book to people unfamiliar, for example, with anything that Deutsch or Popper have ever written, and who might be new to Critical Thinking, and want to have an insight into what perhaps university academics think Critical Thinking is, or think rationality is, and what university students would be consuming in their lectures and tutorials

### 8m

if they take on a course about, let's say, philosophy or Critical Thinking at the undergraduate level. So if you can't afford to have ever gone to Harvard University, say, due to time or money or location, then this is an excellent substitute, I would argue. Now, the book is titled Rationality, but if I could give it a long academic subtitle, it would be something like Perceived Errors in Thinking Using Contemporary Examples Drawn from Political Matters Especially Important in the United States in the Early 2020s. Now, that might be terribly ungenerous. Of course, many of the errors that Pinker is going to discuss throughout this book, errors in thinking, for example, are indeed timeless, even if many are not. And many of the examples won't be. I personally have a preference for more timeless works or works that can be basically picked up by anyone at any time without needing a huge amount of background knowledge

### 9m

about the current affairs going on at a particular time or location when and where the book was written. And this is why I think most of, for example, Popper's works stand the test of time. And, of course, both of David's books are eminently like this. Hopefully what Naval and I have done on that podcast of his is like this. And what, if you ever listen to Jocko Willink, he does these wonderful history wartime podcasts, which you could pick up in the year 3000 and I think they would still stand on their own as great reflections on the conflicts of the past. And the reason I have this preference is that I think that an author or a podcaster, for example, who wants to create a product that does stand the test of time, needs the benefit of hindsight. And that won't be possible while you're still either within the events of the day or immediately after the events of the day. And in many cases I'd say even ten years after the big events of our time

### 10m

won't be long enough. And I'm just labouring this because Rationality, the book Rationality, has references to particular politicians and particular national or sometimes global events and events that happen to still be in progress. And in a sense I guess Professor Pinker is trying to navigate some of the most difficult issues and attempting to clarify ways of thinking best about these contemporary issues. Now before I begin by reading some excerpts from the book and making some comments about those excerpts, I just might make a few more remarks before I begin. Steven Pinker, Professor Pinker, like Matthew Riley, is often spoken about as being one of our prominent optimists. And I think that's quite right. Absolutely these public intellectuals are optimists of a kind but not always in the vein in which the beginning of infinity describes what optimism is. Remember what that is. That is that all evils are due to a lack of knowledge. It's this deep understanding that we can solve problems. Problems are soluble.

### 11m

That's the sense in which we talk about optimism as being linked to knowledge and the knowledge is linked to physics because if there's not a physical law, it's not a law of physics actually standing in the way, of solving the problem. That problem is soluble. And evil, including things that cause suffering, are just a kind of problem, just a kind of thing that we need to turn our knowledge-creating abilities towards. And so that's what we mean about optimism. In the case of Steven Pinker, he's written one of the most popular books on why we should indeed have hope and gratitude for the now, for the time in which we are living, because the past was, of course, so much worse. It's amazing that needs to be said, but it does need to be said because we are living in an era, I think unusually, where things have never been better, but they're talked about as if they're getting worse or that they've never been as bad as what they are now, and yet things are getting better. And I include everything from the economic

### 12m

to the moral, to the cultural, even the political and the environmental and so on and so forth. On every metric, things are better. Things are better than ever. I think Steven Pinker understands this almost as much as anyone. I say almost as much because those of us who've read and fully consumed The Beginning of Infinity will be able to spot times throughout the work Rationality where there seems to be a sense that things are in fact getting worse and have been getting worse for a while. But I think that this comes down to a kind of political bias, in a sense, that because certain political leaders have recently come to prominence that other people think are beyond the pale, then this is an indication that the entire democratic system, for example, is going to hell and that things are getting worse. And I think that's just an error. I think that's an irrationality. But it comes through at certain points within the book

### 13m

and we'll see that. So, also, just before I get to chapter one, what would I say rationality is and how does it accord with what, Stephen Pinker says it is in this book? I suppose what I would say is that rationality is a commitment to correcting errors, to identifying and then correcting errors, something like that. I think that's the way that The Beginning of Infinity kind of frames what rationality is. And there are many ways in which we might try to identify and then go about correcting our errors. And if we are consistently trying to do this, then we're consistently aiming for a rational worldview. And the difference with reason is, reason is all of those techniques which allow us to do that error correction. Sometimes they can be used synonymously. If you say to someone, well, that would be the rational thing to do, you might also say, that would be the reasonable thing to do. And I think that these words, we can't have a perfectly precise language, these words are more or less interchangeable. But it's about error correction.

### 14m

We should expect that all of our ideas contain some errors somewhere or other. And the process of trying to identify them is a rational process. The process of correcting them is a rational process. But this might be just a subtle difference in emphasis when it comes to what Steven Pinker has to say about what rationality is. So with all of that preamble, let's get into chapter one. It's titled, again, in the form of a question, it's titled, How Rational an Animal? And in this chapter, Pinker rightly says that we owe our progress, and he lists some of these, in terms of moral and scientific process, we owe this progress to our being rational, to human beings being rational. Now, of course, I would say, we could clock it up to that. That's totally fine. Or we could clock it up to our being creative, especially our capacity for creating explanatory knowledge. And so that's what makes us different

### 15m

to every other entity in the entire universe, whether that entity is creating knowledge, or not. If it does create knowledge, explanatory knowledge, then it's a person by virtue of that fact. And so that is what enables the progress to occur. And that very capacity, that very capacity of being creative, because it's not perfect, and because it's error prone, might be, well, it is. It's also going to be the process that will lead to error. Because you are guessing what the nature of reality is, you're making your best reasonable or rational guess, and you're trying to correct errors. That's not a perfect process. And so sometimes it will go wrong. And when it does go wrong, well, someone might diagnose that error as being a kind of irrationality. But not always. Just a simple mistake might not be irrational. It might have been your best guess at the time. I can certainly imagine deliberately using false words in a perfectly rational way.

### 16m

Newtonian gravity is one such. We know, technically speaking, strictly speaking, it is, at root, false. Demonstrably false. Experimentally refuted. However, it would be perfectly rational, and it is perfectly rational, to use it in order to fire rockets into space. And there might be reasons why the more correct version, general relativity, might be irrational to use. For example, if you're a kid and you're building a rocket, and you just want to try and predict how high the rocket's going to go, using Newtonian gravity could be a wonderful way in which to get interested in the physics of rocketry. But if someone was to say, well, technically, Newtonian physics isn't true, you should be using Einstein's gravity, then it might take you months to learn the formulas and the mathematics and the formalism in order to make the same prediction using the more accurate theory of physics, the more true theory of physics. So there would be reasons why you might

### 17m

rationally discard what is true and embrace what is false in order to pragmatically achieve what you want to achieve and make progress in the world individually or more broadly than that. Okay, that aside, in this chapter one, people get credit for making progress and it is insinuated, said, that people are special, aside from other animals. He does say, and I find this a little bit obtuse, that some native hunters, the San people, who believe in Africa, quote, owe their survival to the scientific mindset. They reason their way from fragmentary data to remote conclusions with an intuitive grasp of logic, critical thinking, statistical reasoning, causal inference, and game theory, end quote. So this is people who are still living a tribal lifestyle who are hunting in the African plains in order to live,

### 18m

so they are pre-agreed and they don't have farming and so on. Now, this impulse, and this happens across documentaries and it's just a feature of our culture, it's a feature of Western culture, that we praise pre-technology or pre-scientific, pre-enlightenment cultures as having precisely the same level of development as what we do. It's just that they are doing different things. Now, absolutely they have precisely the same anatomical brains as what we do. Absolutely. They have minds that are capable of understanding anything that we do. Absolutely. But they don't have the same ideas that we do. There are strict differences between cultures. Some people use their capacity for understanding the world, their universal capacity for explaining phenomena in the world for things other than doing that,

### 19m

for things other than relentlessly correcting their errors and therefore making progress in the world. So over the last, well in this case, apparently a hundred thousand years, this same extant society has been roughly the same for the last hundred thousand years. They still exist. We would say, in our terminology, this is a static type of society. It hasn't changed much. It's not dynamic. There's no one in that society that is building rockets to go into space. There's no one in that society that's building ever better batteries for solar powered cars. That is building ever faster processes for smartphones and that kind of thing. That's what we're doing. So we are undergoing rapid change. And that's the thing that distinguishes us from all other societies. Namely, that we are able to sustain, to maintain rapid progress. Our society remains stable under rapid change. Which is a very unusual thing.

### 20m

And this is hence why David has this term of a dynamic society. It should be unstable. It should be the case, seemingly, that if you have these sudden changes in society, technological, moral, you have this progress going on, that it should cause great instability and the society completely falls apart. And indeed in the past we can see examples of that having happened. But in ours, that hasn't happened yet because we have this culture of criticism. Now, what's that got to do with what is being said here? Well, Pinker is saying of this tribe, an ancient tribe that still exists, an ancient tribe that still relies upon primitive hunting techniques, rather than being technologically advanced like ours, I would say that the reason they still exist is thus far they have, the culture, not the individual people, the culture has been kind of lucky in the sense that there hasn't been sudden changes in the environment. There's been gradual and slow changes. But if they were to encounter a sudden change,

### 21m

a disease for example, for which they had no natural immunity, unless the West came along with some kind of vaccine or with some kind of other treatment, then they would have to rely upon their existing cultural knowledge because their means by which they create knowledge happens only very gradually. I say all of that because when Pinker says that they are using all of these things, it is kind of trying to praise the ancient tribe in terms that we are familiar with. But is it true to say they are really using a scientific mindset? What's a scientific mindset? Isn't a scientific mindset something that corrects errors in all areas? Isn't it about using experiments to distinguish between the best explanations so far guessed? Can they really explain the world around them? They do have minds, they have minds that are very similar to ours, and you could take any person

### 22m

from that society, put them into Western society, and with some difficulty, the cultural difficulties will be difficult to overcome, but they would be able to learn everything that we can learn. Of course they would. Their mind is universal just as our mind is universal. The thing is, it's not so interesting what is similar about a person in the West who is using a smartphone and driving a Tesla and dreaming one day of going into space, and the person still living in the tribe who has never seen a smartphone before, wouldn't know what a Tesla is, and still has a prehistoric view of what the nature of the cosmos is. Yes, there are absolutely similarities there. The more interesting thing is, why are there differences in the culture? What's going on there at the level of rationality and reason? How do we explain the differences in the ideas and what has led to those ideas persisting or changing or not over time? That's the curious thing here. And of course what I would say is this culture of criticism

### 23m

and the primacy placed upon trying to generate explanatory knowledge rather than relying upon rules of thumb which resemble some kind of explanatory knowledge. Like Pinker lists game theory and statistical reasoning, but for me that just reeks here of the fallacy of the noble savage. The idea that the hunter-gatherer societies can be explained more or less by precisely the same kinds of knowledge as a modern Western civilization, that seems strange to me. There must be an underlying explanation in terms of ideas. Or is it, I guess, some combination perhaps of imperialism and theft? That would be a common way of explaining why tribes remain in the state that they are. The only reason that they don't have access to free and universal healthcare, for example, is because of some kind of imperialist attacks from the West on them that are keeping them in that state.

### 24m

Or the relativist argument that their condition is just as good as ours. Their society is just as good as ours in all respects and no one should ever feel sorry for a child born in that society as compared to born in our society. They are just as able to thrive and flourish in that society as we are. And of course, I think this is completely false. That if truly given the choice, a person who is living in a pre-industrial society on the plains of Africa, hunting wildebeest in order to survive, would jump at the opportunity of living somewhere in the United States, wealthy and safe and healthy. Now, Pinker goes on in Chapter 1 to say, and quote, he says, quote, the cognitive wherewithal to understand the world and bend it to our advantage is not a trophy of Western civilization. It is the patrimony of our species. End quote. And yes, to some extent,

### 25m

yes, the cognitive wherewithal is certainly there. It's there in every human, no matter where they are, from what part of the earth. This is what makes things like racism so ridiculous, irrational and abhorrent. Because every single individual person has exactly the same, as he says there, cognitive wherewithal to understand the world. The question then becomes, why do some people really, truly want to understand the world? Why are those people found in the West? And why, if you are born into one of these more pre-industrial societies that still exist, whether in the forests of Brazil or the plains of Africa or the deserts of Australia, why do these people not strive to, to really understand, for example, the laws of physics? To aspire to have the next best iPhone that's released? To get an ever faster, more powerful Tesla? And so on and so forth.

### 26m

What's the difference? Well, it's not the cognitive wherewithal, is it? It can't be that, because we've admitted that it's the same. It's the same universal mind operating in all of these brains, no matter what the particular race, if you like. I don't subscribe to this notion of race. I think it's ridiculous. We are the human race. No matter what the background or ethnicity is, the cognitive wherewithal is the same, the mind is the same. So then, what makes the difference? What makes the difference is the knowledge and the ideas, and in particular, the knowledge about knowledge. Hence the importance of the theory of knowledge. Okay, so if you have this stance of wanting to criticize the ideas that are out there for the purpose of improving, therefore if you have a tradition of criticism in your society, the society overall will improve. And what we say is the difference is the existence of a tradition of criticism in one society, the West, and the rank rejection of criticism of ideas in these more pre-industrial societies.

### 27m

The pre-industrial societies, for everything that Pinker said there, let's just go back, the list of things that he says that they use, they have an intuitive grasp of logic, critical thinking, statistical reasoning, causal inference, and game theory. Apparently they're using all of these things. And he uses the example of hunting. He's saying that when they're hunting something, they're using all of these things. I don't know that they really do use critical thinking in the way that we might think about it or the way that I've tried to explain here in this podcast series. It was just my most recent podcast where I talked about the existence of the chief and the medicine man. Theirs authorities are people who in the tribe would tell everyone else what to do. Often the medicine man would tell the chief, the chief would then order everyone else to follow this particular piece of wisdom, false though it might be, sometimes useful, sometimes not. But the point is, rarely were people able to defy the chief and the medicine man. There'd be very severe and violent punishments in these tribal societies

### 28m

for going against the authorities. You couldn't simply criticize in an open-ended way every single idea. So the extent to which there is this true culture of criticism is open to debate. Maybe there were sections about which tribal society can think. Maybe hunting wildebeest. You're allowed to think critically about hunting the wildebeest, but you better not think critically about how this society is organized, for example, or whether and to what extent you can leave the tribe and go somewhere else. That, for example, or how it is that the children are raised in that particular society and so on and so forth. So it's not like this universal application of those things that Pinker lists would actually happen in these tribes. So when Pinker talks about that these things are not a trophy of Western civilization, the mind is not. The mind has been gifted to us by evolutionary processes. That's where the mind comes from.

### 29m

Would be my guess. Maybe there's also something to be said for the way in which children are raised early on and certain memes need to be incorporated into the infant's mind so that they can think broadly about these issues. I'm not so sure. I think maybe just every baby is born with the capacity of having a universal mind. I think that just happens. Whatever. If we're talking about trophies of civilization when it comes to rationality, absolutely, absolutely it is a trophy of Western civilization that we have a tradition of criticism. That is a bright line between dynamic societies, societies that have this open-ended exploration of the space of ideas to whittle down what is false from what is more true and societies that remain static that do not have this and that tend eventually to go extinct. So whether these San people that is used as an example here by Pinker,

### 30m

whether they will persist off into the future has everything to do with the extent to which they will embrace a tradition of criticism. And when they do, they'll be part of the West. And they won't be hunter-gatherers anymore because they will choose not to be because the rational thing would be to choose to do those things which enable you to be happier, healthier, wealthier, wiser. People want progress. People want to solve their problems including people who live in pre-industrial societies. And it is incumbent on us. We're wrong to not offer them that. Certainly we shouldn't force it on them but this, this tendency to be utterly hands-off and to not even show them that there is a better way I think is immoral. So as I say, brains of people around the world are more or less anatomically identical. We're all of the same species. We're all of the same race. So we have the same kind of brains.

### 31m

So it has to be that the ideas that people have is the difference in the culture that causes the difference between these different societies. And that difference is the thing that's worth lingering on in any book about rationality. But what I'm finding is that Pinker emphasizes how they are scientifically minded. They're critical thinkers who use Bayesian reasoning and they're good conservationists as well. They embrace reciprocity and the collective well-being of the tribe. They keep all that in mind. It's as if reading this first bit in chapter one their existence, the tribal existence, sounds almost utopian in how ideal it is painted. I'm almost left wondering after reading about these Saan tribe people from Africa still remaining as hunter-gatherers. I'm left at the end wondering why, given their wonderful capacity in thinking all these ways, why they don't have the flying cars yet.

### 32m

And it's buttressed this discussion of the virtues of the Saan people. A buttress very quickly up against our people in our society who are subject to gambling and the irrationality of gambling and of embracing fake news, for example. So I guess what Pinker is saying from an evolutionary point of view, as is his style, is that if indeed our brains and minds have evolved for survival and ancient tribes manage that so well that, for example, in this particular example he's using, that tribe has remained in existence for 100,000 years, 100,000 years of continuous success in the same place they've had. Why is it that that same mind that allows for the continual survival of that particular tribe also leads in the modern world to all of our bad ideas that we have like fake news and the tendency to buy lottery tickets? Well, what I would say in response to that is I think there's no great mystery here. There is no great mystery.

### 33m

There's irrationalities in the tribe and there's rationalities in Western civilization and vice versa. Rationality is an application of creativity and creativity is going to produce error as much. In fact, no, not as much. It's going to produce error more often than it generates the correction of an error. Correction of errors is quite hard. Generating errors is quite easy and it's going to happen in both places. At high rates in some societies there is less ability to correct errors simply because of the way that children are raised. To think outside the box beyond what is permitted to think about. For example, simply leaving the society might be a taboo. So long as the climate does not change too much and too fast a static society can remain in existence for a long time. It can persist. But it always remains vulnerable to the inevitable change that will indeed come. Our society, only our society has so far proved so resilient

### 34m

in the face of rapid change. Because we have this error correcting mechanism that operates at all levels of our society from the individual through to institutions and their leaders. The San people have been resilient but only under very slow change in the climate and the world around it. If there was a terrible flood, as I say or a disease or a war tomorrow they could in all likelihood be wiped out by something that would not wipe us out. Chapter 1 also sees Pinker discuss some simple math and logic problems. I'll mention one of those but I won't steal his thunder by going through all of them. You should get the book for that. They're very interesting. He says that people make mistakes with these sorts of simple maths and logic problems for various reasons. He quotes Kahneman and the thinking fast and slow idea. There's this idea that there's System 1 that's for rapid thinking and that seduces us into the wrong answer

### 35m

for many of these simple questions. When what we really want is to engage System 2 which is the slow and deliberate way of thinking about and understanding the problem behind such questions. I often personally find all these sorts of examples a bit strange. I've written before about certain logical maths problems that people make a big deal about. For example, this one the Singapore maths problem. Sometimes these things can be subtle and difficult to understand. It's a skill. Like mathematics and physics like music these things, these techniques solving these problems have to be learned. Some people are interested in spending lots of time they have fun doing these things. I used to be like this. But others don't. Whether or not being able to think well about some abstract logic puzzle whether or not that translates into thinking well about your own life decisions or decisions that should be made politically in broader society

### 36m

I would say is at best an open question. But more than likely you can see wonderful examples of people who are brilliantly mathematically and logically minded in the abstract sense who struggle to understand some simple concepts. And in fact Pinker himself is going to discuss Paul Erdős who's this prolific mathematician and he's got this wonderful anecdote in the book about this and I can't wait to get to that one because it's something I learnt knew about Paul Erdős I didn't know about this. We'll come back to that. But take for example Ted Kaczynski a famous mathematician not so much famous for his mathematics although no one can doubt his mathematical proficiency but he was the Unabomber, right? So this is a guy who could understand logic and mathematics and reason abstractly quite well but ended up being a terribly violent antisocial, hostile person who didn't understand the first thing about morality it would seem and so much can be said about

### 37m

well, the people who crashed planes into the Twin Towers as Sam Harris has made this point so eloquently many times these people some of them were PhDs and engineers and that kind of thing having the ability to think rationally in the way that is sometimes explained rationally even having the capacity to solve these logic problems is no bulwark against having bad ideas it's the bad ideas that you can embrace that you think you've embraced rationally in fact you might have embraced rationally you know again Sam Harris makes this point that if you are a religious fundamentalist then you only have to accept for whatever weird reason to you it might be rational but if you genuinely think that paradise awaits if only you blow yourself up in a suicide bombing and that not only is this good for you because you'll go to paradise but you'll be helping these infidels also learn the lesson that this is the set of ideas they need to embrace in order to secure

### 38m

an eternity of paradise and holiness and sacredness and all that kind of thing so that is rationality rationality in perfect service to evil rationality of that kind now I would say of course well these people aren't trying to correct errors and these people don't have an error correcting mindset what they're doing is closing off they are closing off any possibility of error correction once you kill someone you've completely closed off the capacity to correct errors and some of these people of course they're dogmatists they don't think it's possible to correct an error which is why I say rationality is better thought of better thought of as this desire to identify and correct errors and as soon as you David Deutsch's moral injunction right as soon as you say I don't there is no error to correct here or you're not permitted to correct an error here the anti-rational idea of destroying the means of error correction that's truly what is anti-rational

### 39m

or irrational even but certainly anti-rational it prevents you from being able to think about ways in order to make progress by correcting errors okay so here in this chapter one there is one example I'll just mention the way in which people can sometimes not think logically but as I say I'm not sure it really makes the point that people are irrational for example okay the problem is imagine you've got a patch of weeds on a field somewhere and you are told this patch of weeds doubles its size every single day and it's not until the 30th day that the entire field is covered by weeds okay so we've got that I want you to think about it for a moment we've got this patch of weeds it's doubling in size every single day and on the 30th day the field is completely covered the question then is how long does it take

### 40m

for half of the field to be covered by weeds now I'll give you a moment so it's being doubled so the patch of weeds is doubling every day for 30 days at which point it covers the entire field how long did it take for half of the field to be covered well the answer is 29 days right so 29 days is how long it takes now sometimes this can seem surprising to people but of course if you think to yourself well on the 30th day it's completely full so if it doubled every day how much of the field was covered the day before the 30th day namely the 29th day well half of it because on the 29th day it will double and then the entire field will be covered so but some people think you know I don't know I suppose some people will think 15 days or something like that now why would this appear in a book on rationality well I think I think that and there's a series of these questions again get the book for more examples of these questions that Pinker is drawing from elsewhere to illustrate a particular point

### 41m

but what is that point well I think it's the point that if people don't have a ready understanding of a question like that then the diagnosis is well they won't have a good understanding of things more broadly like exponential growth when it comes to an issue like and he will come back to this COVID so people will be irrational about COVID why because they don't understand exponential growth why because they can't do a simple problem like how long it takes for the weeds to cover half of a field well maybe maybe but like I say like I say people like Ted Kaczynski can be perfectly proficient mathematicians and simultaneously be completely irrational so these two things sometimes don't marry up it's what else you know I think it's what else you know that really helps with this kind of thing okay so that aside my favourite example and so this is the only other one I'll draw from but he spends a long time on this and I've spent some time on this before on previous podcasts as well

### 42m

a certain kind of failure of logic which I think is more illustrative of people's capacity to think in a certain kind of logical way or is it because as Pinker himself is going to get to there's a better way of expressing this same problem in ways that people typically are able to get the correct answer so it's got to do with the degree to which something is abstract versus concrete as we might say in educational circles so I'm actually going to read from the book as I do with certain other books so I'll begin it's called the this test is a famous one it's called the Wasson Selection Test and it's titled in Pinker's book A Simple Logic Problem quote if anything lies at the core of rationality it must surely be logic he says the prototype of a rational inference is the syllogism if P then Q P therefore Q consider a simple example suppose the coinage of a country

### 43m

has a portrait of one of its eminent sovereigns on one side and a specimen of its magnificent fauna on the other now consider a simple if then rule if a coin has a king on one side then it has a bird on the other here are four coins displaying a king, a queen a moose and a duck which of the coins do you have to turn over to determine whether the rule has been violated if you're like most people you said the king or the king and the duck the correct answer is the king and the moose why? everyone agrees you have to turn over the king because if you fail to find a bird on the reverse it would violate the rule in so many words most people know there's no point in turning over the queen because the rule says if king then bird it says nothing about coins or the queen many say you should turn over the duck but when you think about it that coin is irrelevant the rule is if king then bird not if bird then king

### 44m

if the duck shared the coin with the queen nothing would be amiss but now consider the moose if you turned that coin over and found a king on the obverse the rule if king then bird would have been transgressed the answer then is the king and the moose on average only 10% of people make those picks the wassen selection task named after its creator the cognitive psychologist peter wassen has been administered with various if p then q rules for 65 years the original version used cards with a letter on one side and a number on the other and a rule like if there is a d on one side there is a 3 on the other time and again people turn over the p or the p and the q and fail to turn over the not q it's not that they're incapable of understanding the right answer as with the cognitive reflection test as soon as it is explained to them they slap themselves on the forehead and accept it but their unreflective intuition

### 45m

left to its own devices fails to do the logic what does this tell us about human rationality a common explanation is that it reveals our confirmation bias the bad habit of seeking evidence that ratifies a belief and being incurious about the evidence that might falsify it people think that dreams are omens because they recall the time when they dreamt a relative had a mishap and she did but they forget about all the times when a relative was fine after they dreamt she had a mishap or they think immigrants commit a lot of crime because they read it in the news about an immigrant who robbed a store but don't think about the larger number of stores robbed by native born citizens confirmation bias is a common diagnosis for human folly and a target for enhancing rationality francis bacon often credited with developing the scientific method wrote of a man who was taken to church and shown a painting of sailors who had escaped the shipwreck thanks to their holy vows aye he remarked but where are they painted

### 46m

that were drowned after their vows he observed such is the way of all superstitions whether in astrology dreams omens divine judgments or the like wherein men having a delight in such vanities mark the events where they are fulfilled but where they fail although this happened much oftener neglect and pass them by end quote from bacon echoing a famous argument by the philosopher karl popper most scientists today insist that the dividing line between science and pseudoscience is whether advocates of a hypothesis deliberately search for evidence that could falsify it and accept the hypothesis only if it survives end quote this is also the only mention of popper in pinker's book in rationality now i'm going to now i'll agree with what pinker says here and i won't read the part but basically the the idea here is with the wasson selection test including the one about coins and the more classic example involving p's and q's and stuff

### 47m

the the issue is that it's abstract that if you bring it into someone's real life thinking about stuff then they tend to do better you know it's well known that that that people are more interested in being able to solve problems involving numbers than doing algebra typically speaking and when those numbers actually have a dollar sign associated with them then it's easier still because it means something to them they care about it if people don't care about the question you're asking them they lose interest they get bored and they switch off and they don't do it it's got nothing to do with their capacity i would suggest to think more broadly about stuff this is why iq tests are so tubious so many of the questions so often are asked abstract i took courses at university called logic philosophical logic mathematical logic so at the end you would think anyone who went through this would be able to think logically not necessarily i mean they can manipulate the symbols and go through proofs that's what they can do

### 48m

and a proof is a kind of computation it's a mechanical process that you go through starting with your axioms using the rules of inference getting to the conclusion but simply doing that doesn't mean that you can necessarily apply those things necessarily apply those things in a in a good way to real life problems and conversely if you're really good at the real life problems that doesn't mean that you can apply it in an abstract way and Pinker actually explains this as he goes on to say quote suppose the post office sells fifty cent stamps for third class mail but requires ten dollar stamps for express mail that is properly addressed mail must follow the rule if a letter is labeled express mail it must have a ten dollar stamp suppose the label and the stamp don't fit on the same side of the envelope so a postal worker has to turn the envelopes over to check to see if the sender has followed the rule here are four envelopes imagine that you are a postal worker

### 49m

which ones do you have to turn over the correct answer is once again P and not Q namely the express envelope and the one with the fifty cent stamp though the problem is logically equivalent to the four coin problem or the PQ problem this time almost everyone gets it right the content of a logical problem matters when an if then rule implements a contract involving permissions and duties if you enjoy a benefit you must pay a cost then a violation of the rule take the benefit don't pay the cost is equivalent to cheating and people intuitively know what it takes to catch a cheater pause there my reflection yes that's one explanation okay and that's a very concrete way of thinking about it or just people are interested in this your eyes captured by this

### 50m

your mind is captured by this more readily for the reasons of identifying a cheater perhaps or just the fact that you're familiar with these things you're familiar manipulating things like envelopes and stamps and coins and money we've been trained since mother's knee on this but not using P's and Q's necessarily thinking in an abstract ways you have to be specifically interested in those things and then spend time learning about those things finding those things fun to some extent in order to be able to do them reliably over and again okay so that's the Wasson selection test and I think it illustrates I think that what Pinker does really well here is illustrate the context matters the examples really do matter which kind of makes these academic ways of explaining what critical thinking is it sort of suggests that again you can be really really proficient at so called logic and yet still be illogical in various ways or be really logical in a practical sense

### 51m

using envelopes let's say but being unable to do that in an abstract way reliably as well and it's not you wouldn't label either person perfectly rational perfectly logical okay these are just labels that apply in a particular context okay so then he talks more about some logic more about logic again I'll skip that because that'll come into chapter 3 and so we can spend more time on that but then he gets to the very classic Monty Hall problem something I've mentioned more than once but here we've got some really interesting historic context so let me go to that because I wasn't aware of this particular part of it and I think one of the reasons is well I'm just not familiar with the Monty Hall show I think I first heard about this problem reading a book somewhere or other it might have been 20 years ago or something I read a book that described the Monty Hall problem but I wasn't culturally familiar with the Monty Hall problem as I think people in America are

### 52m

so let's go through it the way Pinker does it okay so this is from the book quote one of the most famous television game shows from the heyday of the genre from the 1950s to the 1980s was Let's Make a Deal its host Monty Hall achieved a second kind of fame when a dilemma in probability theory loosely based on the show was named after him a contestant is faced with three doors behind one of them is a sleek new car behind the other two are goats the contestant picks a door say door 1 to build suspense Monty opens one of the other two doors say door 3 revealing a goat to build the suspense still further he gives the contestant an opportunity to either stick with their original choice or to switch to the unopened door you were the contestant what should you do? almost everyone stays they figure that since the car was placed behind one of the three doors at random and door 3 has been eliminated

### 53m

there is now a 50-50 chance each that the car will be behind door 1 or door 2 though there's no harm in switching they think there's no benefit either so they stick with their first choice out of inertia pride or anticipation that their regret after an unlucky switch would be more intense than their delight after a lucky one the Monty Hall dilemma became famous in 1990 when it was presented in the Ask Marilyn column in Parade a magazine inserted in the Sunday edition of hundreds of American newspapers the columnist was Marilyn Vos Savant known at the time as the world's smartest woman because of her entry in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest score on an intelligence test Vos Savant wrote that you should switch the odds of the car being behind door 2 are 2 in 3 compared with 1 in 3 for door 1 the column drew 10,000 letters a thousand of them from PhDs mainly in mathematics and statistics most of whom said she was wrong

### 54m

pausing there my reflection so this is the path I didn't know about the Monty Hall problem it's astonishing some of this stuff that I read and we're going to get a mention about Paul Airdish here as well my understanding of the Monty Hall problem the thing that really just makes it clear for me and I think Pinker mentions this as well many other people have mentioned it Sam Harris and various others this idea that all you need to do is to consider not three doors consider a thousand doors if you consider a thousand doors and you pick one of them and then he closes all other doors except for one what are you going to do? are you going to change or not? clearly you've been given information you're going to stick this one door which has at the moment a one in a thousand chance of being the correct door behind which the car is and then Monty says I'm going to close 998 other doors and I'm going to leave one do you still really think that the chance that the car is behind your door is one in two? is that really the way to think about it? or is it one in a thousand? and now the other one

### 55m

is 999 out of a thousand that it's going to be in fact the door behind which the car is it seems pretty obvious you're being given information so whether it's a thousand doors or three doors you should swap that is the mathematically rational logical thing to do so I knew that but I didn't know this part here are some examples says Pinka of the kind of responses that the person in question what was her name? someone savant Marilyn Voss savant so although she explained what the correct answer is she had mathematics PhDs writing to her here's one here's one of the responses quote you blew it and you blew it big is this Donald Trump? you blew it and you blew it big since you seem to have difficulty grasping the basic principle at work here I'll explain after the host reveals a goat you now have a one in two chance of being correct whether you change your selection or not the odds are the same there is enough mathematical illiteracy

### 56m

in this country and we don't need the world's highest IQ propagating more shame! exclamation mark end quote that was Scott Smith PhD University of Florida I like that one personally I like that one because it sounds like some YouTube comments I've had over the last couple of years all right we'll go to the next one Pinka has quoted quote I am sure you will receive many letters on this topic from high school and college students perhaps you should keep a few addresses for help with future columns W. Robert Smith of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States Robert Smith PhD Georgia State University maybe women look at math problems differently than men Don Edwards Sunriver Oregon but now is the best bit that Pinka gets into quote Pinka writes among the objectors was Paul Erdős 1913-1996 the renowned mathematician who was so prolific that many academics boast of their Erdős number the length of the shortest chain of co-authorships

### 57m

linking them to the great theoretician end quote so that's fantastic that's absolutely fantastic you know that even this guy that is really held up he's famous among mathematicians he's famous among anyone who's ever taken an interest in mathematics if Paul Erdős is writing in to say that the correct answer is actually wrong and doesn't understand why that's phenomenal and well let's go on because Pinker explains what eventually convinced Erdős he was wrong Pinker writes but the mansplaining mathematicians were wrong and the world's smartest woman was right you should switch it's not that hard to see why there are three possibilities for where the car could have been placed okay I'm not going to go through this is me talking um what the answers are because I've already explained that and anyone who wants to can simply look it up you should switch the chance of being right as Marilyn Vos Savant said is two and three if you switch only one in three if you stay um Pinker goes on

### 58m

to say certainly quote certainly there were failures of critical thinking coming from sexism ad hominem biases and professional jealousy Vos Savant is an attractive and stylish woman with no initials after her name who wrote for a recipe and gossip filled rag and bantered on late night talk shows she defied the stereotype of a mathematician and her celebrity and bragging rights from Guinness the Guinness Book of Records made her a big fat target for a takedown but part of the problem is the problem itself like the teasers in the Guinness Book of Records the cognitive reflection and Watson selection tests something about the Monty Hall dilemma is designed to bring out the stupid in our system one but in this case system two is not much brighter people can't swallow the correct explanation even when it's pointed out to them this included who violating the soul of a mathematician was convinced only when he saw the game repeatedly simulated many persist even when they see it simulated and even when they repeatedly play

### 59m

for money the mismatch between our intuitions and the laws of chance a clue comes from the overconfident justifications that the know-it-alls offered for their blunders sometimes thoughtlessly carried over from other probability puzzles many people insist that each of the unknown alternatives in this case the unopened doors must have an equal probability that is true of symmetrical gambling toys like the faces of a coin or sides of a die and it is reasonable start and and it is a reasonable starting point when you know absolutely nothing about the but it is not a law of nature pausing their yes that's all quite right fantastic well explained an and again get the book because pink goes into even more analysis of this particular problem with with with the examples in the book he does go into a lot of detail with many of these things you know my preference would be well you could probably have

### 1h 0m

have done it in in half the amount of words but you know as an introduction to let's say rationality yes this level of detail is is good so that that there that analysis of the Monty Hall problem by Stephen Pinker I think is absolutely fantastic that's that's worth the price of the book alone because it does as much work as any other example in the entire book to illustrate the difference between rationality and irrationality I think and to really put a pin in this idea that if you're a highly trained academic and you're mathematically proficient that somehow you can think more clearly by virtue of the fact that you have understanding in the specialized area that this understanding of mathematics of the ways of thinking logically and Paul Erdish is second to none in being able to think this way that does not make you immune from making errors even errors within your own area of expertise and so people can be irrational they can be

### 1h 1m

completely irrational even about the areas where they're supposed to be experts that's worth keeping in mind that's worth me keeping in mind it's worth everyone keeping in mind no matter what your speciality is you can make terrible blunders and we shouldn't be accusatory of people or having a go at people on the other side of the political aisle or who have different ideas to us because they're making a particular mistake because you are just as fallible as they are everyone is fallible and what the Monty Hall problem the history of the problem shows and what we're talking about there what Pink is talking about there is you know having having this level of overconfidence when it comes to something so simple and that you can make errors in something so simple even if you're operating up here there's a really high level and you think you understand these rarefied areas of mathematics but when it comes to the same the basics the absolute basics of something like probability theory you can make

### 1h 2m

terrible mistakes but that doesn't stop you making progress at the really high level either okay so there's there's lot there's lots of ways you could think about and analyze what's going on here and I guess reflexively in the spirit of that you know what I'm saying here about the work of Stephen Pinker I think it's very good but at the same time I think like Paul Erdish although it's his area of speciality I think sometimes in this very book he makes fundamental egregious errors to some extent let's go to one of those let's go to just one of those page 22 and 23 where he's talking about again logic and probability and people might be able to guess what I'm going to say about this when I get there so what Pinker does in this particular part is to talk about the conjunction fallacy the so-called conjunction fallacy so I'm going to skip ahead to where he describes it accurately and he

### 1h 3m

uses something from Zversky and Kahneman and it's called the the Linder problem is what they have the Linder problem and the Linder problem works well but earlier in the book Pinker changes the Linder problem to something else and in my opinion ruins it ruins it for important reasons let's see the way that Zversky and Kahneman originally put the Linder problem here we go this is from their work quote single outspoken and very bright she majored in philosophy as a student she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations please indicate the probability of each of these statements Linda is a teacher in elementary school Linda is active in the feminist movement Linda is a psychiatric social worker Linda is a bank teller Linda is an insurance salesperson Linda is a bank teller and a

### 1h 4m

and is active in the feminist movement respondents judged that it was likelier that Linda was a feminist bank teller than that she was a bank teller once again the probability of A and B was judged to be higher than the probability of A alone the dated vignette with its baby boomer Linda backhanded compliment bright passe protests and declining occupation betrays its early 1980s vintage but as any psychology instructor knows the effect is easily reprimanded and today highly intelligent Amanda who marches for black lives matter is still deemed to be likelier to be a feminist registered nurse than a registered nurse okay so pausing there my reflection yes so this is this idea the conjunction fallacy that if you put these two things together they seem to be more probable than one of the things on their own which mathematically is of course impossible now the problem I have with the way Pinker does this that reading it again actually that doesn't really work for reasons I'll come to

### 1h 5m

um I think the conjunction fallacy is fine and whatever else but framing it in terms of probability is problematic let's explain why here we go this is what Pinker says earlier on in the book he subtitles this a simple forecasting problem quote once we get into the habit of assigning numbers to unknown events we can quantify intuitions about the future forecasting events is a big business it informs policy investment risk management and ordinary policy about what lies in store for the world consider each of the following events and write down your estimate of the likelihood that it will take place in the coming decade many of them are pretty unlikely so let's make finer distinctions at the lower end of the scale and pick one of the following probabilities for each less than 0.1 percent 0.1 percent 0.5 percent 1 percent 2 percent 5 percent 10 percent 25 percent and 50 percent or more so here are the claims

### 1h 6m

that Pinker wants you to assign a probability to one Saudi Arabia develops a nuclear weapon two Nicolas Maduro resigns the president of Venezuela three Russia has a female president four the world suffers a new and even more lethal pandemic than COVID-19 five Vladimir Putin is constitutionally prevented from running for another term as president of Russia and his wife takes his place on the ballot allowing him to run the country from the sidelines six massive strikes and riots force Nicolas Maduro to resign as president of Venezuela seven a respiratory virus jumps from bats to humans in China and starts a new and even more lethal pandemic than COVID-19 eight after Iran develops a nuclear weapon and tests it in an underground explosion Saudi Arabia develops its own nuclear weapon in response end quote end the list of things there that Pinker puts there now if you are familiar with the work of David Deutsch

### 1h 7m

and you have an understanding of the role of the United States in the United States then what can we say about this absolutely none of them in the list are matters of probability they are all either going to happen or not going to happen the probability in each case if that's what you want to call it is that thing will happen in our timeline or that thing will not happen in our timeline if it happens it happens with probability one if it doesn't happen and you die then throughout your life the probability of it having occurred is zero it never would have changed in the way in which your life would have been lived or was lived which would change the fact that it either happened or didn't happen things happen or don't happen they don't happen with a probability of 0.5 percent or 50 percent or anything like that number one on the list is Saudi Arabia develops a nuclear weapon what's the probability of it happening is there a right answer to this if you put down the probability of it happening is 50 percent what does that mean what does it really mean because it's either going to happen or not

### 1h 8m

in the next hundred years or thousand years or whatever and if it happens it happens with probability of 100 percent whether it happens is completely determined by the knowledge that people in Saudi Arabia who are making the decisions about to build a nuclear weapon actually construct that knowledge on it if they construct the relevant nuclear physics knowledge and they construct the centrifuges and they manage to get hold of the uranium or plutonium or whatever then they can develop a nuclear weapon but not otherwise so far as we know this is what is required in order to develop a nuclear weapon and none of those things are matters of probability but matters of choice and constructing explanatory knowledge in order to do so it's not a matter of probability now of course this is being a little unfair to what Pinker is doing because what Pinker is doing is trying to illustrate a different kind of error the error of this conjunction fallacy that people tend to say things like for example number two on the list

### 1h 9m

Nicolas Maduro resigned as president of Venezuela sometimes they will assign that with a particular probability they might say oh there's a 20 percent chance of that happening but then you go further down the list and it's number six says massive strikes and riots forced Nicolas Maduro to resign as president of Venezuela well people assign that a higher probability they might say 40 percent because they've been told well massive strikes and riots well they kind of think well that thing will cause Maduro to resign but of course the reason for Maduro resigning is going to reduce the the probability according to this particular way of analyzing things so you should always assign a lower probability for that conjunction of things than you should for the thing that is just standing on its own namely his resignation as president for whatever reason has to be higher the reasons for it occurring and it will occur

### 1h 10m

it will occur for some reason it's going to occur he's going to resign well either he's going to die in office or he's going to resign or be voted out or something or he's going to leave office for some reason but if you were going to assign a probability for that i would say 100 eventually he's not going to be present ever he's not going to be president for whatever reason given a particular reason you know the um the massive strikes and riots has to bring that probability down when you put those things together that's what pink is saying here so i'm being unfair to him because you know that's all he's trying to say here but there are other ways of talking about this conjunction fallacy which don't require you to talk about things that aren't matters of probability and especially in a course at a university where you're doing critical thinking or rationality i would hope that students will be comfortable putting up their hands saying but none of these are matters of probability but they're not you know they're they're either going to happen or not going to happen we don't live in a world where things happen

### 1h 11m

probabilistically and that includes by the way the flipping of coins subjectively yeah subjectively you don't know you know that it's going to land heads or tails but when you do flip it and it lands well it's landed with heads and that you live in a universe where the probability of it beforehand was in fact in fact 100 that it was going to be heads because the laws of physics determined that's what was going to happen but subjectively you just didn't have the relevant information anyway that gets too far afield from what we're doing in this book of course but just to turn the mirror of rationality back on to professor pinker for a moment okay and as we move towards the end of the chapter chapter one i've sort of i haven't read much i've talked more about it than i read um we get to cognitive illusions and i would say to you buy the book for that it's really interesting things to say about how these illusions in my words anyway some of these illusions i'll put

### 1h 12m

a picture on the page um really are about the extent to which our prior knowledge affects what we perceive what we see or in other words as popper would say observations are theory laden so i'll skip most of that but just to say that if we're writing a book on rationality why you would skip critical rationalism the preeminent way in which people should be the normative claim they should be thinking rationally i don't know why you'd skip popper because popper explains that sort of thing these these kind of illusions that appear in the book here namely this one here and there's so many like this you know the the you know the the dress example is one but here's another one where um the the the dark area here and the light area here in fact aren't dark and light they are exactly the same color it's an optical illusion and what popper would say as

### 1h 13m

well observations are theory-laden our our very senses themselves are expecting a certain thing and so our brain causes us to see something which is illusory and the way that pinker frames this is of course well in real life in real life when you see something like that a box like that indeed you do see the front of it as being darker than the back of it and so forth because there's such a thing as shadows okay so i'm skipping through to chapter two chapter two and chapter two is titled rationality and irrationality he begins with a complaint that rationality is supposedly uncool and i guess this depends on what circles you mix in i know when i was at school myself as a student myself yes the words geek and nerd were pejorative but i know for a fact now certainly in some schools maybe the better ones that i've been familiar with anyway they're now badges of honor uh there there are subcultures of kids who are nerds and geeks and so on who

### 1h 14m

are exalted as being the popular and the cool kids that's just the way it is so the kids exist in subcultures some kids want to be geeks now they aspire to be you know the next generation of elon musk's and bill gates and why not i mean that's where the money is if that's the way in which you want to be successful so i think that's changed over the last few decades he does go on to make some remarks that of course i'll agree with about the poverty of post-modernism all of that's quite well but then we get to this um so i'm skipping the first part of the chapter uh and he writes okay he's he's got a subsection titled reasons for reason and he asked the question what is rationality as with most words in common usage no definition can stipulate its meaning exactly and the dictionary just leads us in a circle most define rational as having reason but reason itself comes from the latin ration

### 1h 15m

often described as reason a definition that is more or less faithful to the way the word is used is the ability to use knowledge to attain goals knowledge in turn is standardly defined as justified true belief end quote so he takes this um uncontroversially okay so this is just assumed true throughout the book and because it is then we can have a book about rationality and the rational ways in which we can try and justify as true our beliefs and if you're not adequately justifying things then this is irrational and indeed he goes on to say quote straight after that after saying that knowledge is justified true belief this is the standard definition he writes quote we would not credit someone with being rational if they acted on beliefs that they

were known to be false such as looking for their keys in a place they knew the keys could not be or if those beliefs could not be justified if they came say from a drug-induced vision or a hallucinated voice rather than observation of the world or inference from some other belief end quote yes the example is correct but the explanation for the example is not the explanation for the example is not as i said earlier there are all sorts of reasons why rationality is not justified in which you can act i won't use the word belief but you can act on knowledge you know to be false you don't indeed you don't have to believe it at all newton's theory of gravity newton's theory of gravity newtonian mechanics you can know it to be false and therefore you should not believe it because you know it's false but it can be perfectly rational to act upon it for example in building a bridge

in launching a rocket you can use this not because it is strictly speaking true let alone justified true or that you believe it but because it solves a particular problem that's what it's about if you are seeking to solve your problems and in doing that correcting errors to the extent the errors need to be corrected that's rational and of course it's not a matter of beliefs whatever beliefs are i struggle to really understand what this concept of belief seems to be on the one hand you look up a dictionary and it's defined as being something like those things you regard as being true so known to be true or whatever in other moods people tend to use the word to mean something lesser than the word no but as i have emphasized here you should be using the word no for things that you think could be false

### 1h 18m

i also know that it's false knowing something doesn't mean that you think that it's actually true it might simply mean well it's the best explanation that i have but not always it could just mean that you know it even though you know that it's false but believe if i say i believe something i i believe the sky is blue then on the one hand it might mean you really really think that the sky is blue like i believe in god when people say i believe in god they think i really really think that god exists in fact it's often the one thing that i believe in god and i believe in god it's the thing that they refuse to give up on it's the thing that they endorse as being true more than anything else but other times when you say believe it can have a completely different meaning well not a completely different meaning but if i say i believe my mother's in the next room where's mom i believe she's in the next room that indicates a lack of certainty rather than certainty this for me this means that belief shouldn't be a part of epistemology epistemology is about knowledge and we can more carefully

### 1h 19m

constrain what we understand the word knowledge to mean following popper following deutsch without ever being concerned about what this term belief is about what anyone thinks on the matter any particular person it's about the extent to which the errors have been corrected and knowledge of course unlike beliefs is something that can be instantiated in objects that that a book doesn't believe anything but it absolutely contains knowledge it contains knowledge that can be transmitted from one place to another but then he goes on to talk about the fact that knowledge is something that can be transmitted from one place to another but then he goes on to talk about more about beliefs no i think this is what i suppose can also make the book valuable for anyone as i flagged early on if you felt like you missed out on a course at harvard university on epistemology or critical thinking or rationality or from any one of the other you know top universities whether in the ivory the ivy league universities in the united states or you know oxford or cambridge if you think you missed out on philosophy if you think you missed out on

### 1h 20m

the absolute best teaching that's out there then this book contains some of that i think it's useful to know what is being taught and what the content of epistemology is in these institutions and is commonly thought to be critical thinking and so on so it's an excellent it's an excellent summary the book is an excellent summary of critical thinking rationality as understood in academic circles as as we notice here and this is such a perfect example and david deutsch has observed this before when you read these kind of books it's as if popper had never existed it's as if he just he's he's not the key philosopher involved in epistemology we see it there this is a wonderful example of where popper gets invoked how falsification of course you know he he was the guy that figured out that what science is about it's falsifying ideas

### 1h 21m

rather than verifying as true ideas confirming as true ideas and this is the extent to which your university academic and professor broadly speaking even if they're engaged in philosophy of science even if they're engaged ostensibly in epistemology this is what they think popper contributed it you don't need to write multiple books of that length there as popper did and essays and lectures and so on and so forth to just make that point that's not what his corpus of contribution to philosophy and science and epistemology is it is far broader and deeper than that and it really matters it really matters on this point about knowledge being justified true belief why because if we need to have justified truths in order to claim something is actually known then we readily slide into dogmatism or relativism

### 1h 22m

and pinker will know this better than anyone i suppose or as well as anyone that if you can't justify as true something and people quickly realize they can't really justify something as true as absolutely true and so because of this what happens when they fail to do so and they will fail to do so in the university context what do they do they fall into relativism they fall into post-modernism they go well it's all pointless you can't in science justify something that theory is true after all science is always overturning its theories therefore nothing is absolutely true therefore everything stands on all fours with everything else let's just be relativists because nothing can ultimately be shown to be true this mistake only comes about because people think that to know something means to justify it as true serious problem affects the universities it's an entire philosophy that comes from i would argue that central mistake of thinking

### 1h 23m

that knowledge is about trying to justify as true something and it's not now on the other hand on the flip side if you're not in the university if you're not in the rarefied areas of university and coming to this realization yourself then what you do is you go down the other equally false route of thinking well the only way to justify things as true is to be dogmatic if it's written in the holy book or somewhere else if the scientist says it then it's justified as true you become a dogmatist then you you rely on authoritarianism the authority of the person who is in possession of that ultimate truth the dogmatist will say to you it's justified as true because it's written in this book or it's been peer-reviewed or this priest has said and so on and so forth this expert has said then i'm justified in thinking this is true therefore i can say i know it both of these things are equally false it's wrong to say that there is

### 1h 24m

no truth because you can't justify things as true it's wrong to say that everything else is false other than what the people who are the experts and authorities say is actually justified as being true that's what we know no popper dismisses both of these and says it's not about justifying things as true it's not about justifying beliefs as true forget all of that knowledge is conjectural you guess it you error correct you look for the problems in what you hitherto know correct the errors identify better solutions and therefore make progress and along the way you say i know this thing either as my best explanation of reality or i know this thing to be false or i know this thing to be false but useful this is what knowledge is knowledge is useful information knowledge is that information which tends to get itself copied knowledge is that stuff which once instantiated in some sort of physical substrate tends to cause itself to remain so knowledge is resilient information all of these are similar ways

### 1h 25m

of circling the same idea but at no point do we need to say they are justified as true nor does anyone have to believe them that's wonderful that's unique that's different and why it doesn't inform books on rationality courses on critical thinking i don't know because it's a much better in terms of being able to slice through the bs that exists on either the side of the dogmatists or the relativists you only get this problem of dogmatism and relativism if you go down the platonic road okay plato's idea that you need to be able to justify as true your beliefs that's an error and it causes so many other problems so this is not this is why i'm focusing on it and why i'm ranting about it right now this is not a minor academic problem it is very serious it affects academia but it affects the world it affects the world it affects the world it affects broad normal day-to-day life discourse in the world out there we've got religious fundamentalists

### 1h 26m

on the one hand causing problems for everyone and post-modernists on the other causing problems for everyone as well popper is needed because these ideas affect people's behaviors so i think that you know opportunities are missed to explain popper to a broader audience we know that steven pinker has read and respects david deutsch so he could have gone back but he's not going to go back to the beginning of infinity that he he read he says uh for enlightenment now he could have just referenced something from that book about knowledge but all of that said okay so i've i've um criticized uh steven pinker great steven pinker i think he's great he does excellent work you know again he's an ally but this is why i think that yeah should he write more books on this topic and hopefully he does he he goes back and reads what popper has to say promotes popper a little more but he does get he gets objective truth right let me skip to um page 40 now so let me go ahead and he writes this

### 1h 27m

quote now arguments for truth objectivity and reason may stick in the crawl because they seem dangerously arrogant who the hell are you to claim to have absolute truth but that's not what the case for rationality is about the psychologist david myers has said that the essence of a monotheistic belief is one there is a god and there is a god and there is a god and there is a god and two it's not me and it's also not you the secular equivalent is there is objective truth and two i don't know it and neither do you the same epistemic humility applies to rationality that leads to truth perfect rationality and objective truth are aspirations that no mortal can ever claim to have attained but the conviction that they are out there licenses us to develop rules we can all abide by that allow us to approach the truth collectively in ways that are impossible for any of us individually pausing there my reflection yes but an opportunity has been missed here so the final ultimate absolute truth is unobtainable

### 1h 28m

but it's out there but this can also cause people to fall into relativism if you say that if you express it in in that way what you immediately need to follow it up with is nonetheless objective knowledge objective knowledge is absolutely possible it's not the final word justified as true it's knowledge it's useful information it's knowledge that solves information that solves a problem that's what objective knowledge is it either objectively solves the problem or it doesn't that's a true or false claim and that is easily noticed in the world so it can get confusing if on the one hand the instructor at the front of the critical thinking or rational rationalist course rationalism course says to the cohort of students hey guess what there's this thing called knowledge it's justified truth it's not the final word it's not the final word how do we justify as true our beliefs well we can't in the next breath we can't actually get to the

### 1h 29m

absolute justified objective truth so it must mean that knowledge isn't quite possible either but hey we can follow methods of rationality that lead to the truth all of this gets confusing and i understand why an undergraduate or even a graduate coming out of such a course might be confused and fall into a dangerous form of laziness and it's not the final word it's not the final word what we need is to be able to tell people guess what despite this inability to get to the final truth correct steven pingo we can't get to the final truth there is such a thing as objective knowledge knowledge that could be wrong it has the possibility of being wrong of being shown wrong but until such time as it actually is shown wrong and it has proved thus far to solve our problems we regard it as actual knowledge it's objective knowledge objective because it could be shown false and when it is sometimes it still maintains its

### 1h 30m

usefulness as knowledge newton's theory okay the rest of the chapter there's more material rightly criticizing relativism and post-modernism uh with a slant he's kind of got a slant here in the book and in this chapter about our present circumstance where people are obsessed with various phobias and isms to do with race and class and gender and they're not going to be gender and sexuality yes absolutely so um it it's it it to me it it very much as i say it's like notes for a lecture at a university okay this is what the university uh and i guess the media in various places are um kind of focused on right now these this race class gender sexuality stuff um and so um the the examples there uh circle that and so it's useful for an undergraduate going through university or again someone who would like to be familiar with what might be talked about in lectures at a modern university these days now he does spend

### 1h 31m

um lots of the chapter defending reason against unreason i suppose um like sometimes i'm left wondering who he's debating like who are these people out there that are arguing against reason um you know even people that we disagree with even as i say the religious fundamentalist they would think they're they're behaving rationally and reasonably they've just taken on the wrong idea right if if the idea is if you blow yourself up in a suicide bombing you're going to go to paradise and this is the most holy and good thing that you can do with your life it's rational to do it okay we might think it's evil and wrong and whatever and we need to go deeper and to criticize his original ideas namely thinking that particular ancient books contain the final truth okay that's a problem but once you accept that false premise other things fall out logically many people have made this point before i think in in um this kind of

### 1h 32m

book it's enough to say that reason works unreason doesn't reason leads to solving your problems to making progress unreason does quite the opposite okay it leads to static societies and you can't correct your errors because you're not aiming at correcting your errors so he gets to a point in the book in chapter two where he asked the question quote must we always follow reason do i need a rational argument for why i should fall in love cherish my children enjoy the pleasures of life isn't it sometimes okay to go crazy to be silly to stop making sense if rationality is so great why do we associate it with a dour joylessness was the philosophy professor in tom stoppard's play jumpers right in his response to the claim that the church is a monument to irrationality and then he quotes the play quote the national gallery is a monument to irrationality

### 1h 33m

every concert hall is a monument to irrationality and so is a nicely kept garden or a lover's favor or a home for stray dogs if rationality were the criterion for things being allowed to exist the world would be one gigantic field of soya beans end quote from the play the rest of this chapter takes up the professor's challenge we will see that while beauty and love and kindness are not literally rational they're not exactly irrational either we can apply reason to our emotions and to our morals and there is even a higher order rationality that tells us when it can be rational to be irrational pausing there my reflection uh as i say if you embrace the idea that rationality is more about correcting errors and making progress you don't fall into this debate so much is love rational rational is keeping a garden let's make it even easier is keeping a garden rational absolutely why

### 1h 34m

well if it's fun it's rational why because as we like to say around here reason is fun there's absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying life that should be the purpose and how do you enjoy life by continually solving your problems correcting errors making personal progress in whatever way you think you should meaning of life is solving your problems and if you fail to continue to solve your problems you'll become unhappy and ultimately you will die if you can't solve that problem at the end there and i think professor pinker does make this point in in the book around about this time that well it's wrong to think that there is this opposition between reason and emotion that makes no sense lots of people have made that error over time i remember um sam harris would talk about this as well that you know um people would accuse him

### 1h 35m

of being overly rational for whatever reason and that you know you might not be able to prove that god exists but that's being too rational after all can you prove that you love your children well it's a ridiculous question okay in neither case is it about proof i would say in the first place but what we're really looking for is how can we prove that we love our children and that's explanations and rational explanations or non-rational explanations and it's perfectly rational to have a good explanation of why you would love your children or you would want a garden and so on and so forth all these things that people enjoy it doesn't make them irrational it doesn't make it irrational just because you enjoy something you could jump out of an airplane okay you could be one of these people who likes going skydiving that does not make it irrational it can be fun fun is rationality having fun is rational having fun is perfectly rational what's the alternative not to have fun that would be irrational wouldn't it just to avoid fun all the time again this is why

### 1h 36m

reason is fun right doing stuff that involves reason is actually fun and part of perhaps the central part of life for more on that see of course the work of lully tannett among others and david's the fun criterion now chapter two also invokes the wonderful teaching the horse to talk um uh example which is in the beginning infinity as well and we also get in this chapter uh being a cognitive scientist a psychologist of course this idea of the the marshmallows can you wait for the marshmallow in the hope that you'll get two in the future or do you want to eat the marshmallow now and psychologists make a lot of this because children when um offered a single marshmallow but told don't eat the marshmallow now wait 10 minutes and i'll give you two some of them eat it and some of them don't it's impulse but all of these kind of examples just like as pinker says elsewhere in these first two chapters

### 1h 37m

that it's in a sense more rational to save money now for your future than spend it now in many many cases but then later on he does double back on that and goes well it kind of depends on well he doesn't use these words but it depends on what your problem problem situation is at any time okay if you um of course have sickness ill health something like that then you might very well need to spend all of your money now your savings now rather than save for the future you might need to cure an illness that you have right now there's many situations like this in which using up the resources now rather than saving for the future is the more rational thing to do neither of these things that you can't make a black and white claim about what to do with money resources marshmallows right now if you're really hungry as a kid in that experiment then having the marshmallow right now makes more sense than the kid who's just eaten breakfast they might be able to wait more easily for 10 minutes because

### 1h 38m

and the kid who has low blood sugar diabetes might really might really be very rational for them to have the marshmallow immediately rather than wait 10 minutes for two marshmallows when they've fallen unconscious okay um i don't think i'll read the rest of this chapter it's good okay there's but there's lots of stuff there about and carbon and pollution which makes me think and again it sort of stands in contrast to some other things that steven pinker writes um about how good the present is he's kind of suggesting that the present isn't that good because when it comes to pollution this is a standard example the past was extremely polluted all the ways in which the water supply was polluted uh or in which we couldn't which we couldn't deal with bushfires or forest fires and so the air used to get more polluted now of course in the industrial revolution the air was even worse but by any metric today

### 1h 39m

in many many places the air is far cleaner than what it was a few decades ago i know in the united states it's certainly like this oh yeah of course china is coming up and burning lots and lots of coal and they're putting lots of rubbish into the atmosphere yes but there's a transitional phase they'll get through this and then their air will be as clean as the united states and australia and so on and so forth and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so forth once you once you get to the point where you have nice clean coal or other clean forms of energy nuclear and so on then your your air will become clear and of course and of course car technology a major contributor to making air look grimy and dirty and having these little particles well things can get better things can get so much better if you just improve the technology with transportation means of transportation but i might just end it on uh pinker talks about how we can't get an aught from an ears and you know this is david hume fork now he makes a big deal about this he thinks that it's false it's true you can't get an aught from an ears um but as david deutsch

### 1h 40m

points out and it's the key point many people miss it's a key point that many people miss in the philosophy and epistemology of david deutsch his great insight is explanations are not derived in the first place they're guessed that's what you get this from popper which means not only can't you get an aught from an ears you can't get an ears from an ears either okay that's just not the way that explanations work that's not the way that science works the mistake is you know you don't just look at photons of light falling down to the earth and go oh those photons mean that it is the case that general relativity is true or that you know light is made of photons or that light is a wave or any anything else of interest in science just because you see something is the case does not mean you can't get an aught from an ears you can't get an aught from an ears either you can get the explanation of what is the case the explanation has to be creatively conjectured and then measured against the experimental observations that you make this is an encounter

### 1h 41m

between what we imagine to be the case and what we measure and observe to be the case as well so whenever you hear people make a big deal about you can't get an aught from an ears true you can't get an aught from an ears but you can't get is's from is's either you don't derive morality from a natural world but you don't arrive what's true in science philosophy or anything else from what is the case in the natural world alright so that's worried about in summary for these first two chapters and excellent overview of rationality as I imagine it is still taught in the university context with lots of contemporary examples drawn from news stories and the culture of today and extremely well really good ізl cifen Brush is currently in the actual role of Bi загleran on the junt looks quite interesting on how if it's not typical they've joined our cause then there's actually no written as well so very useful for people who are new to this idea of critical thinking

### 1h 42m

but if you've read Popper and Deutsch you might find as I did that on every other page there was something that you kind of raised your eyebrows ahead and thought there might have been a better way to have expressed this or this could have been better informed certainly by the epistemology known as critical rationalism which I think is the greatest bulwark against irrationality until next time bye you
