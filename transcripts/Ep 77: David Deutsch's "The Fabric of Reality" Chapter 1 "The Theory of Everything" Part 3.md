Welcome to TopCast and episode three, or part three rather, of chapter one, The Theory of Everything from The Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch. Before I begin, a little note on my setup. Some people have been saying that it's a bit distracting when I'm actually reading from one of the books that I read from because I'm not staring straight into the screen. I'm going to try and remedy this. If anyone has any ideas for me about precisely how to go about doing that so it's not so distracting, I'd be happy to hear them. But one of the reasons it hasn't been a priority is because the overwhelming majority of people actually only listen. They don't actually watch. I think the downloads from the podcast version, the audio-only version, are like 10 times greater than the views that I get on YouTube. And so it would be so much more simple, efficient if I didn't bother putting together the video

### 1m

because the video actually takes a lot longer to edit and all that sort of stuff. Audio is much easier to deal with. Nonetheless, I like doing the video, so I'm going to persevere with that. But if you have any ideas about how I can read by doing this, which is me like looking at the screen right now, while simultaneously looking straight at the camera, I would appreciate it. Here's an iPhone, one of the more recent iPhones, well, iPhone 11, in order to actually record the video and the audio goes into that. Don't need to go into the technical details. But anyway, if you have an idea for how I can fix the way in which I look at the camera whilst simultaneously reading, then that would be great. I know a thing called an autocue exists, but presumably that's quite a professional piece of gear. Anyway, no more preamble. Let me get into the video. The reading for today, and we're getting very close to the end of the chapter. It's a very

### 2m

fun part of the end of the chapter because we start to encounter some real seeds, and I'm going to mention that word a few times today, real seeds of the science of canon cards, which is sitting there behind me by Chiara Marletta, the beginnings of constructor theory. They're right here in the fabric of reality, and so I'm going to concentrate a little on that today. Not in the fabric of reality, in the first few pages of the fabric of reality. So let's go, and I'm at the point where David says on page 23, quote, in the reductionist worldview, the laws governing subatomic particle interactions are of paramount importance, as they are the base of the hierarchy of all knowledge. But in the real structure of scientific knowledge, and in the structure of knowledge of reality, such laws have a more humble role. What is that role? It seems to me that none of the candidates for a theory of

### 3m

everything that has yet been contemplated contains much that is new by way of explanation. Perhaps the most innovative approach from the explanatory point of view is superstring theory, in which extended objects, strings, rather than point-like particles, are the elementary building blocks of matter. But no existing approach offers an entirely new, mode of explanation, new in the sense of Einstein's explanation of gravitational forces in terms of curved space and time. Pausing there, just my reflection on this. So David has said right there that nothing about the other conceptions of the way in which we might improve physics off into the infinite future, string theory as one such, is a new mode of explanation. This term, mode of explanation, is right there at the beginning of the fabric of

### 4m

reality. And that's remarkable, because here, in 1997, we have the motivation for constructor theory. We have the phrase, mode of explanation. We can see those seeds, as I've talked about in previous episodes for the fabric of reality, for what is happening right now, over the last few years, and right now in 2021. It's almost like a prediction of the content of future knowledge, isn't it? Not quite. That's a joke, of course. But it's clear David is appealing for a new way forward in physics. It seems like no one else really took up the mantle between 1997 through to today. So he did, and Chiara, and others. And it's another good reason for me to be doing this book right now alongside Chiara's book. Here we are getting the appeal for that new fundamental theory. And there, in Chiara's book, we are getting the description and explanation of what has been accomplished, so far, with this exact new theory, constructor theory. So it's a wonderful symmetry between the

### 5m

two books. Back to this book, the fabric of reality. And David writes, quote, In fact, the theory of everything is expected to inherit virtually its entire explanatory structure, its physical concepts, its language, its mathematical formalism, and the form of its explanations from the existing theories of electromagnetism, nuclear forces, and gravity . Therefore, we may look to this underlying structure, which we already know from existing theories, for the contribution of fundamental physics to our overall understanding. There are two theories in physics which are considerably deeper than all others. The first is the general theory of relativity, which, as I have said, is our best theory of space, time, and gravity. The second, quantum theory, is even deeper. Between them, these two theories, and not any existing or currently envisaged theory of subatomic particles, provide the detailed explanatory and

### 6m

formal framework within which all other theories in modern physics are expressed, and they contain overarching physical principles to which all other theories conform. A unification of general relativity and quantum theory to give a quantum theory of gravity has been a major quest of theoretical physicists for several decades, and would have to form part of any theory of everything in either the narrow, or the narrow, or the narrow, or the narrow, or the narrow, or the narrow, or the broad sense of the term. As we shall see in the next chapter, quantum theory, like relativity, provides a revolutionary new mode of explanation of physical reality. The reason why quantum theory is the deeper of the two lies more outside physics than within it, for its ramifications are very wide, extending far beyond physics, and even beyond science itself, as it is normally conceived. Okay, pausing there, just my reflection on this. So, yes, quantum theory is the deeper of the two. We've got general relativity, and we've got quantum theory, both of which

### 7m

purport to be explanations of the universe as a whole, in a certain sense. The reason why quantum theory is the deeper of the two is because it affects other areas of our knowledge more so than what general relativity seems to. In another video that I did called The Nexus, which was some personal musings on the nature of persons, I showed you that quantum theory is the deeper of the two. I tried to describe what the implications are of our most modern understanding of quantum theory upon this question of what it means to be a person. Because we exist in a multiverse, and the multiverse consists of these interesting entities called fungible things. Okay, so fungibility is this idea of where a particle, or even a larger object, an ensemble of particles, which includes something like a human body, is extended across the multiverse. And so in order

### 8m

to understand the nature of personhood more fully, you need to grapple with quantum theory. So I think quantum theory absolutely has deep implications for the nature of personhood. It also, of course, has ramifications for the field of computation. And this is what David Deutsch actually proved in his famous 1986 paper, one of the things he's most famous for beyond writing, books, is this particular proof that he did, this proof of the possibility, the physical possibility of quantum computation, which means that now computation is truly a part of physics. So quantum theory's got ramifications there, and therefore it's also got ramifications for mathematics, because it provides a limit, constraints, on what can be proved, given those quantum mechanical laws. So because quantum mechanical laws are universal, they apply to everything in the universe, including the brains of mathematicians,

### 9m

it limits what those brains of those mathematicians can do, or what computers can do, that are made out of matter. And so quantum theory has this reach into mathematics, even into pure mathematics, because it is the very thing which tells you what laws, computers, things that prove stuff, which includes human brains, can do. What they are able to do. And then it also reaches, therefore, into epistemology, beyond mathematics, because it provides constraints on our ability to perfectly know anything at all. We are necessarily fallible, because we're error-prone human beings due to just making mistakes. But those mistakes are also embedded there in the laws of physics. And related to this, quantum theory mandates it. Everything can be known simultaneously. That matter behaves in ways governed by quantum mechanical laws,

### 10m

such that we have to rule out epistemic certainty, or, in simple language, no, you cannot be sure of anything. You can have good explanations, but they must remain fallible. Even the contents of your own memory must remain fallible, given quantum theory, among other things. And so that has ramifications for psychology, and so it goes. So these are just some of the senses in which quantum theory has implications for all those other areas that we typically partition off from the rest of science. Okay, back to the book, and David writes, Quantum theory is one of what I shall call the four main strands of which our current understanding of the fabric of reality is composed. Before I say what the other three strands are, I must mention another way in which reductionism misrepresents the structure of scientific knowledge. Not only does it assume that explanation always consists of analysing a system into smaller, simpler systems,

### 11m

it also assumes that all explanation is of later events in terms of earlier events. In other words, that the only way of explaining something is to state its causes. And this implies that the earlier the events in terms of which we explain something, the better the explanation. So that ultimately, the best explanations of all are in terms of the initial state of the universe. Just pausing there. There we're getting constructor theory again. This idea that the best explanations are in terms of something that happened earlier that caused something to happen later is, of course, all this dynamical laws and initial conditions vision of physics. This kind of narrow way of viewing the way in which the universe evolves over time. And the way in which change happens at all in the universe. Back to the book. David writes, A theory of everything which excludes a specification of the initial state of the universe is not a complete description of physical reality

### 12m

because it provides only laws of motion. And laws of motion by themselves make only conditional predictions. That is, they never state categorically what happens, but only what will happen at one time, given what was happening at another time. Only if a complete specification of the initial state... is provided, can a complete description of physical reality, in principle, be deduced. Pausing there. Yeah, my reflection again. So, I have heard theoretical physicists, specifically particle physicists, say that the deeper theory of everything would be one that would provide the initial conditions in some way as a matter of necessity. Like mathematical necessity. Now, I suppose that's one way to go. Of course, all you... You then get out of that so-called theory of everything. Is again, this reductionist idea that gives you, that would give you, the initial conditions and then the dynamical laws, presumably. And you would have this deeper theory, this deeper mathematical theory that says,

### 13m

well, these initial conditions can only be in such and such a way. But whatever that theory is, that gives you these initial conditions of the universe, you might ask, of that theory, why it has the form that it does. I suppose you get into some kind of infinite regress then. I don't know exactly how they resolve that. Anyways, whatever the case, David, in that passage there, and in the next few passages, is really emphasising this idea that this initial conditions, dynamical laws kind of thing, the laws of motion and initial conditions problem, doesn't seem to be able to provide a true theory of everything. So, he's really providing clues there for someone else, had they wanted to create constructor theory. It reminds me a little bit of... Another book that I've read recently called From Zero to One, which is by the entrepreneur Peter Thiel. If you don't know who he is, he's Elon Musk's sort of off-sider.

### 14m

He's another billionaire. He was Elon Musk's off-sider. He worked on PayPal and so on. Smart guy, businessman. Anyway, his book, From Zero to One, is about how to create a business or a start-up. Young people come up to him and want to know how to become rich themselves by creating a new business. They seem to be after the recipe. They seem to be after the algorithm. Of course, his advice is he can't possibly tell you that. Because there is no such algorithm. There is no recipe. If it were that simple, then everyone would just follow the recipe and become rich. But that's the very point about creativity. Similarly, physicists want to make fundamental breakthroughs. They need creativity. Here in the Fabric of Reality, we've got the same thing. There are clues here for the taking. For anyone who might have wanted to... ... ...conceive of a new mode of explanation. But the thing is, with any of this stuff, it has to be a very personal thing. It has to be part of your personal problem situation, as Popper might put it.

### 15m

Unless you are truly, really invested in the problem, then you won't spend much time thinking about it. David did, of course. So much that he wrote a book on it. And then he went on to begin to solve the problems that he is laying out here in Cosmos. The point is, anyone can do it. They just have to choose to do it and become interested in it. But most won't. Most won't actually be that genuinely interested. Even people with physics degrees. I have a physics degree. That doesn't mean anything in terms of trying to create fundamental theories. Because that's not part of my problem situation. I'm genuinely not deeply interested enough. I'm more interested in, for example, in my problem. Trying to explain ideas that have already been discovered. In new ways. So that people out there who have a casual interest can to some extent level up and learn more about this.

### 16m

And perhaps then develop a really deep interest in it. I think that's what sort of my function is in this. I don't have any illusions that I'm going to make deep breakthroughs here. But maybe someone listening will be enticed to go off and do it. And read the details. Read the technical details. And then they, perhaps, will make some of the more fundamental breakthroughs. It all depends on what you find fun doing. I have fun just talking about this. And solving the problem of trying to explain it with ever more clarity. In more and more simple terms. To the extent that I can. But what I notice sometimes is that, well, I'll just say it. Sometimes people seem to kidnap me. People seem to kid themselves. I see this in physics to some extent. People who say they either want to be physicists. Want to make breakthroughs. They're already in physics. But you dig a little. And it's quickly apparent that this is not how their life is quite set up.

### 17m

They're actually invested rather more in other things. They have other interests as well. They have other problems. And that's perfectly fine. But there might be something that psychologists call. To the extent that it exists. Cognitive dissonance. Not really being aware that your explicit words about what you're trying to achieve. Don't quite match up to what you're doing day to day in reality behind the scenes. To put this another way. Einstein, it might have been thought while he was working at a patent office. Was just working on relativity as a kind of hobby. But that would be to misunderstand what was going on. So many of his waking moments were devoted. Solely to figuring out these problems. He was obsessed by the fun of finding this stuff out. And later on being a physicist wasn't a job that he clocked into. And worked up until morning tea. And then clocked off again. And then went back to work at his desk for another few hours.

### 18m

While checking emails and so on. No. He was utterly obsessed with figuring out specific problems. And he made progress because he was passionate. And he found joy in solving. These particular problems. And there's a difference there. Between that kind of approach towards problem solving in a specific area. And those who might say that that's what they want to do. But instead are splitting their attention and their fun between many other things. And of course that's totally fine. This is not a judgement. It is the difference between being able to. Because you have a finite amount of attention. And a finite amount of creativity. Given a certain amount of finite time. In order to solve particular problems. And if you are utterly obsessed with certain problems. Then you're probably going to make. You're possibly going to make more progress there. Than someone who is not quite so obsessed.

### 19m

That's my diversion on the psychology of making progress. In physics and in elsewhere. I don't do it often. And I'm not about to be doing it often here either. So let's go back to the book. And David writes. Current cosmological theories do not provide a complete specification of the initial state. Even in principle. But they do say that the universe was initially very small. Very hot. And very uniform in structure. We also know it cannot have been perfectly uniform. Because that would be incompatible according to the theory. With the distribution of galaxies we observe across the sky today. The initial variations in density. Lumpiness. Would have been greatly enhanced by gravitational clumping. That is relatively dense regions. Would have attracted more matter. And become denser. So they need only have been very slight initially. Pausing there. Yes. My reflection on this.

### 20m

This lumpiness was a mystery for some time. It was a mystery until the COBE. The satellite telescope called the Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer. Which took the first images. Somewhere between 1989 and 1993. Of the Cosmic Microwave Background. The heat left over after the Big Bang. Now prior to COBE. The thing was that wherever we pointed our telescopes. Effectively temperature probes at the sky. We found exactly the same temperature everywhere. 2.3. Above absolute zero. 2.3 Kelvin. Or 2.3 degrees Celsius. Above absolute zero. The minimum possible temperature. So the universe is bathed in this heat. But it's extremely uniform. And that is. That's kind of a problem. It's a problem because. The universe itself. When you look in the visual band. Or in any other band. Aside from the microwave band. If you're looking. If you're looking at things. Other than. At that temperature. You find that. There's a lot of things. Other than.

### 21m

At that temperature. You find that. There's a lot of things. Other than. At that temperature. There's a lot of things. Other than. At that temperature. You find lumpiness. As David says here. And this is in fact what. The astronomers. And the astrophysicists. Talk about. And the cosmologists. Talk about. They talk about the lumpiness. Of the universe. Of the universe. There are regions. Where there are galaxies. That's a lump. And the regions. Between galaxies. Which have nothing at all. But why is the distribution. Of matter. The way that it is. Given the cosmic microwave background. Is not lumpy. Well. The cosmic microwave. Background explorer. This satellite. That was put up there. In the late 80s. Early 90s. Revealed. That. In fact. The. Cosmic microwave. Background. Is lumpy. After all. It's not perfectly uniform. It has. These. Regions. Of. Cooler. And warmer. And the cooler areas. Are going to be. The places. Where. In the early universe. The matter. Would have. Been attracted.

### 22m

Towards. That's where. It would have collapsed. And in the warmer areas. Where the matter. Would have expanded out. So you get the voids. In the area. Of higher. Temperature. And in the cooler areas. That's where the galaxies. Form. And that's where the stars. Form. That's where your. Your glowing. Matter. Forms. And. And. And. This is. This is. George. Smoot. Was awarded. The. Nobel. Prize.

universe i would argue and there is predictable in practice and there's predictable in principle and i want to suggest that neither in principle neither in practice nor in principle can we make predictions about the universe as a whole let me give the we can't predict things in practice for the whole universe this is the easy one in order to be able to predict in practice how the universe is going to evolve over time with certainty of some kind that would mean to know the conditions of the universe right now or the initial conditions of the universe which is basically the same thing one's not necessarily going to be easier than another presumably right now finding the conditions right now every single particle would be easier than finding the conditions of every single particle in the deep dark past because we only have access to measurements right now so can we get this perfect knowledge that we need of every single particle in order to

### 35m

plug in this supplementary data into our equations of motion for all the particles in the universe it would seem to be clearly not one would wonder by what mechanism you're going to make these measurements of every single particle in the universe what instruments would you need to do this what what are they made out of and are these instruments themselves that do the measurements of the particles themselves made of particles for which you need to do these measurements of every single particle in the universe so can we get this need to know their conditions at any given time we have a recursive problem don't we we'll need instruments measuring instrument we'll need instruments measuring particles the positions and momenta presumably of particles but those instruments themselves are made of particles so we need to find the momentum and the position of those particles as well in the instruments but

### 36m

to do that we need more instruments so we've got this weird infinite regress of trying to measure everything including the the measuring devices themselves so i don't think that in practice it's possible and in principle we've got a problem as well people often say things like well the oracle or the supercomputer to to to take it away from the supernatural the supposed quantum supercomputer of the future might be able to somehow you you have the conditions of all particles in the universe plugged into it and thereby make a perfect prediction of how the universe is going to unfold off into the infinite future but i don't think that it can and and and one reason why i don't think that it can is because the conditions right now the the whatever the conditions are at time t call it now in in in this room where i am

### 37m

are going to be different to the conditions for particles on the other side of the galaxy let alone the other side of the universe there is no now here now that is the same for here as compared to the other side of the galaxy relativity tells us that whatever you think is going on here right now might be well and good but your knowledge of what is going on over there is limited by the finite speed of light you cannot know now what is happening over there is limited by the finite speed of light you cannot know now what is happening over there is limited by the finite speed of light you cannot know now what is happening over there is limited by the finite speed of light you cannot know now what is happening over there is limited by the finite speed of light you cannot know now what is happening over there is limited by the finite speed of light you cannot know now what is happening over there is limited by the finite speed of light you cannot know now what is happening over there is limited by the finite speed of light you cannot know now what is happening over there is limited by the finite speed of light you cannot know happening there now because guess what? There is no simultaneous now here and now over there. That is known as the relativity of simultaneity. Now I'm somewhat practiced in explaining this so let me do it very very briefly. This is the classic so-called thought experiment and it goes like this. Let's say you're sitting in the middle of a train and it's a special kind of train where you can pull a chain in the middle of the train and it will turn on a light that is

### 38m

immediately above your head and to your left and to your right there is a door and the door is opened at either end of the train by a light. So as soon as the light when you switch it on reaches the doors the doors will open. So if you're right in the middle of the train and you pull the chain and the light switches on then it will reach if you're right in the middle of the train it will reach the front and the rear doors. Simultaneously it will reach both of those doors at the same time so both of the doors will open according to you at precisely the same time. Now this is all dependent on the fact that the speed of light is constant. It doesn't matter whether the light is traveling to the left or to the right forwards or backwards to the rear door or to the front door. The speed of light is constant always for all observers. That's a fact. That is one of the postulates of special relativity. But now and here's the key brain bending thing if you've never heard it before. Let's say you're watching

### 39m

from the outside of the train as someone inside the train performs this experiment. They're turning the light on. They're in the middle of the train. They observe the light travel to the front and rear of the train striking the front and rear doors simultaneously causing those doors to open up simultaneously. But you are now on the outside. Let's presume the train is on the outside. The train is now moving from the left to the right. The person inside the train they don't care about this. After all the light's still going to travel a certain distance to the front and a certain distance to the back and that distance happens to be the same. The doors open simultaneously. Ah but for the person outside as they see the train moving from the left and moving to the right what they notice is as the light is switched on as the light is switched on it will travel towards the rear of the train which is coming towards the light now. So effectively that light beam has a shorter distance to travel. It will strike that rear door first whereas the

### 40m

light beam that is traveling towards the front door now has further to travel because that front door has moved away from where the light began and it has further to travel. So for the person outside they see the rear door strike the beam of light causing that rear door to open up not simultaneously with the front door because at the front door the light beam is still going to travel. Yet to reach there because it's a finite speed of light. It can only travel so far in so much amount of time and although it struck the rear door opening that rear door the front door is still closed. So the person on the outside of the train sees that the rear door is opened and the front door has not yet opened. But the person inside the train says no I'm here inside the train and I have seen that both of those doors have opened simultaneously. The person on the outside says no they haven't I can see right now I have made an observation these two doors have not opened at the same time have not opened simultaneously.

Now if you've never heard that before it can screw with your mind a little bit I would suggest okay. This is the relativity of simultaneity and it's to do with the deep fact of the universe which is the speed of light is constant. This is not something that we're used to in day-to-day life. People have struggled for a long time they did struggle for a long time to accept that this is true and physicists know that this is true. And you should accept that this is true because this is the explanation of how things work. So people won't agree about now about what is happening now for the person inside of the train they say that now the two doors open simultaneously. A person on the outside they say no now the doors didn't open simultaneously in fact there is no now in which the doors open simultaneously. In other words even for a simple situation like this we can't agree on what the supplementary data, might be okay we can't agree let alone what's going to happen here compared to the other side of the

### 42m

universe for every single particle. Now there's a proviso here I accept because there is something actually they can agree on that's something that's called the space-time interval they will agree on what that is so there is actually something that's constant in the universe so to speak in relativity but that's beyond the scope of what I'm talking about right now. Anyways this all comes to bear on this idea that we can have something like perfect knowledge in principle of the initial conditions of the universe now or at any other time making what I would suggest an in-principle prediction of the unfolding of the universe despite the fact everything is determined an in-principle prediction cannot be done and because the in-principle prediction cannot be done there's no point debating about what such and such evolution of the universe would be if only we knew. We can't know and among many other things I think this is well there's many

### 43m

ways but this is a this is a reason why reductionists should accept the fact they shouldn't be reductionists but one reason why they can accept the fact that this provides scope for genuine creativity in the universe things to be able to come into being in the universe that weren't there before that can't be adequately explained by an appeal to the laws of physics. Things like knowledge creation. Okay so all of that was just a response to David's sentence there where he says but for the universe most such calculations are intractable. Yes intractable to put it mildly. Back to the book and he writes I have said that we infer the existence of lumpiness in the initial conditions from observations of lumpiness today but that is exceptional. Most of our knowledge of supplementary data of what specifically happens is in the form of high-level theories about emergent phenomena and is therefore by definition not practically expressible in the form of statements about the

### 44m

initial state. For example in most solutions of the equations of motion the initial state of the universe does not have the right properties for life to evolve from it. Therefore our knowledge that life has evolved is a significant piece of the supplementary data. We may never know what specifically this restriction implies about the detailed structure of the Big Bang but we can draw conclusions from it directly. For example the earliest accurate estimate of the age of the earth was made on the basis of the biological theory of evolution contradicting the best physics of the day. Only a reductionist prejudice could make us feel that this was somehow a less valid form of reasoning or that in general it is more fundamental to theorize about the initial state than about emergent features of reality. Even in the domain of fundamental physics the idea that theories of the initial state contain our deepest knowledge is a serious misconception. One reason is that it logically excludes the possibility of explaining the initial state itself. Why the initial state was what it was. But in fact we have explanations of many aspects of the

### 45m

initial state and more generally no theory of time can possibly explain it in terms of anything earlier. Yet we do have deep explanations from general relativity and even more from quantum theory of the nature of time and pausing there again see some more discussion of this in the science of can and can't if you can't wait for my discussion of the fabric of reality chapter 11 which is not going to come for presumably months or of course hopefully by the book by the fabric of reality and get there much sooner. Back to the book David writes thus the character of many of our descriptions predictions and explanations of reality bear no resemblance to the initial state plus laws of motion picture that reductionism leads to. There is no reason to regard high-level theories as in any way second-class citizens. Our theories of subatomic physics and even of quantum theory or relativity are in no way privileged

### 46m

relative to theories about emergent properties. None of these areas of knowledge can possibly subsume all the others. Each of them has logical implications for the others but not all the implications can be stated for they are emergent properties of the other theories domains. In fact the very terms high-level and low-level are misnomers. The laws of biology say are high level emergent consequences of the laws of physics. But logically some of the laws of physics are then emergent consequences of the laws of biology. It could even be that between them the laws governing biological and other emergent phenomena would entirely determine the laws of fundamental physics. This idea that the laws of physics might emerge from some fundamental laws of biology reminds me of that scene in the big bang theory with um Sheldon who's the character who's the theoretical physicist and he's debating with who would

### 47m

eventually be his girlfriend Amy who's a neuroscientist I think and they're arguing about what's more fundamental or what's logically prior the laws of physics or the new laws of neurobiology. Sheldon of course says physics is but Amy has this argument that given that all of what we know about physics comes from human brains anyway an understanding of how they work must be a priori in a way prior to physics. If you really want to understand where physics is coming from you've got to study the human brain therefore neuroscience is deeper than what physics is. Of course that's a silly debate and it misses the point about actually what thinking is and the fact that physics is outside of brains and all that sort of stuff but it made me think of that and that idea that David just says there that's quite the striking claim that the laws of biology and other emergent phenomena might completely determine the laws of fundamental physics would

### 48m

certainly upset the Sheldon Coopers of the world or anyone who wants to argue that the physical laws and initial conditions picture rules out the reality the reality of emergent phenomena free will of course excuse me back to the book and David writes but in any case when two theories are logically related logic does not dictate which of the two theories are logically related. Of them we ought to regard as determining wholly or partly the other. That depends on the explanatory relationships between the two theories. The truly privileged theories are not the ones referring to any particular scale of size or complexity nor the ones situated at any particular level of the predictive hierarchy but the ones that contain the deepest explanations. The fabric of reality does not only consist of reductionist ingredients like space time and subatomic particles but also of life and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and .. I am happier in one and an gdzieś situated collie

### 49m

but 時候 one such theory but the other three main strands of explanations through which we seek to understand the fabric of reality all a level from the point of view of quantum physics they are the theory of evolution primarily the evolution of living organisms epistemology a theory of knowledge and the theory of computation about computers and what they can and cannot in principle compute pausing there my reflection so these are the four strands quantum theory theory of evolution epistemology theory of computation now as i said previously our previous episodes uh this idea of theory of everything well already there's unification happening here and to some extent we must concede the theory of computation really has been subsumed into physics anyway it's a it's a theory of physics so it's it's part of

### 50m

quantum physics i mean the theory of quantum computation really is the theory of computation as viewed through the lens of quantum theory and it places you know strict constraints on what computers can and can't do namely what those quantum laws of physics say that they can and given that brains the things that create knowledge about the universe are a kind of computer then the theory of knowledge really is very much a part of this theory of computation which is a part of quantum physics as well so there are these deep deep links and i said in the nexus video as well well given that we are evolved biological organisms we've kind of we human beings we are the we are the thing the entity in the universe that unifies all of these things in a very real physical way okay we've evolved to create knowledge which is itself a kind of computation that is done by a computer

### 51m

obeying quantum laws of physics okay so again my nexus video for more about that okay let's go back to the book and david writes as i shall show such deep and diverse connections have been discovered between the basic principles of physics and the basic principles of quantum physics and the of these four apparently independent subjects that it has become impossible to reach our best understanding of any one of them without also understanding the other three the four of them taken together form a coherent explanatory structure that is so far reaching and has come to encompass so much of our understanding of the world that in my view it may already properly be called the first real theory of everything thus we have arrived at a significant moment in the history of ideas the moment when our scope of understanding begins to be fully universal up to now all our understanding has been about some aspect of

### 52m

reality untypical of the whole in the future it will be about a unified conception of reality all explanations will be understood against the backdrop of universality and every new idea will automatically tend to illuminate not just a particular subject but to varying degrees all subjects the dividend of understanding that we will eventually reap from from this last great revolution may far surpass that yielded by any previous one for we shall see that it is not only physics that is being unified and explained here and not only science but also potentially the far reaches of philosophy logic and mathematics ethics politics and aesthetics perhaps everything that we currently understand and probably much that we do not yet understand pausing there my reflection if i was to reflect on why i would bother spending so much of my time explaining these ideas why i would devote a rather large fraction

### 53m

of my life to doing this to trying to do public outreach to trying to spread these ideas to try and have people appreciate the significance of this so that they too could perhaps contribute to solving this particular problem then it's all encapsulated there in the world of science and there i mean how much more grand a vision of reality do you want there have been unifications in the past electricity and magnetism into a unified theory of electromagnetism by faraday and gauss and others the unification of a standard model of particle physics the the unification of space and time by einstein you know these unifications that have happened in physics but here david is talking about how we can have the unification of disparate theories in different subjects coming together to give us a far deeper

### 54m

richer explanation of reality as a whole that will touch everything everything everything that we know philosophy logic mathematics ethics politics aesthetics okay he mentions aesthetics of course in the beginning of infinity as well it sharpens that up too so it's not like this is just a throwaway kind of um um hopes that he is that he's dreaming up here there's actually been progress made on lots of these points between the time of writing through the beginning of infinity and through to the science of canon cart his only work as i've said before um quantum computation that entire field was a unification of computation and um quantum theory so it's happened what more do you want to do in the future i mean there's a lot of work to be done in the future i mean there's a lot of work to be done in the future i mean there's a lot of work to be done in the future out of life you know in terms of understanding and being able to solve problems than being able to unify all of that stuff so i can't think of a a better kind of science to really dive into

### 55m

than this one all other sciences are ultimately going to be aspects of this grand theory of everything and of course the interesting thing about this particular theory of everything is it doesn't solve all problems it just provides a framework in which we can come to understand solutions to those problems and we can solve all problems and we can solve all problems and we can better and of course better and so as as as he said elsewhere it would this would only be the first such theory of everything giving us a vision there to see the next theory of everything which would unify even more presumably once we have this this kind of theory of everything we would then it would reveal new problems because for any solution any theory will open up new problems that we could not possibly have imagined before in the world view that we presently hold and so that would enable new better solutions to arise to the

### 56m

new better problems that we discover let's go back to the last very last part of the book and i'll read a little bit of the glossary that's that it's at the end that is at the end of this book as well david writes quote what conclusion then would i address to my younger self who rejected the proposition that the growth of knowledge was making the world ever less comprehensible i would agree with him though i now think that the important issue is not really whether what our particular species understands can be understood by one of its members it is whether the fabric of reality itself is truly unified and comprehensible there is every reason to believe that it is as a child i merely knew this now i can explain it end of the chapter okay and there's terminology at the end there's a there's a little glossary at the end and i won't always read this but i just think that there's some stuff here that that is worth um going over

### 57m

i'm not going to read all the words in the terminology section in the little glossary at the end of the chapter but this is worth pointing out at the end of the chapter he's got a definition of the word explanation and in brackets he says roughly a statement about the nature of things and the reasons for things so there you see and as i asked david in my questions for david one of my recent questions for david is that i'm not going to read all the words in the text in the short so let's see i'll read over to david and you can find these on youtube uh or on podcast uh i might even put a link hopefully i'll remember i'll put a link below this video to this particular one asking david about uh you know sort of the the motivation for uh sharpening up this uh understanding of what an explanation is in the beginning of infinity in the fact is ted talk you know he says that explanations are hard to vary while still accounting for the thing they purport to account for the phenomena they purport to account for but here we don't have that and the reason being the reason um that we don't have it here is because uh he thought and he says of himself you know erroneously he thought that it was just an uncontroversial kind of a word but it's not of

### 58m

course uh we now know that and so he has sharpened it up very helpfully for the rest of us and i think that this really pushes a popperian epistemology ahead uh in a in a very valuable way in because explanations reach beyond science into every other field that we happen to be interested in and it also sharpens up what science is about science isn't merely about testable theories or even testable explanations it's about finding good explanations of things good explanations of things as defined in the fabric of reality go to there go there for that now the next word he defines is instrumentalism and it's a word that comes up here in the beginning of elsewhere and it's going to come up throughout the fabric of reality especially as we talk about the physics sections instrumentalism means the view that the purpose of a scientific theory is to predict the outcomes of experiments now that definition is only you know the only point of

### 59m

that definition it seems to me it only applies to physics and even then usually only to particular kinds of physics particle physics and quantum physics and stuff you know it's a bias from those areas you ask a geophysicist if the purpose of science is to predict the outcomes of experiments and they're not going to be happy with that okay a geophysicist actually wants to know what really is in the center of the earth or in the ground beneath their feet they want to know that that's where the minerals are okay it's not merely predicting that the resistivity found by a particular meter that you're using to look into the ground happens to be this or that that's not what it's about certainly not what an astronomer wants to know either okay astronomer wants to know if there really is a planet orbiting that star or if that star is a white dwarf as opposed to a

### 1h 0m

red giant and so on much less biology medicine think of any science that you're interested in okay instrumentalism is this weird kind of philosophy that some philosophers are interested in and they're only interested in it because there's this bad turn in theoretical physics quantum physics and so on okay the next definition positivism is the next word positivism david says an extreme form of instrumentalism which holds that all statements other than those describing or predicting observations are meaningless this view is itself meaningless according to its own criterion yes precisely okay so positivism just rules out understanding uh the world at all really i mean um describing or predicting observations i mean all of philosophy um mathematics is not about observations you know

### 1h 1m

pure mathematics not about observations but it's very useful there's lots of things that aren't about observations um and anyway all statements i mean what about fiction what about art i mean what what is a positivist supposed to and this is where wittgenstein so yes it's called the two versions of wittgenstein you know we blame wittgenstein for a lot of this right ludwig wittgenstein in his uh tractatus his first book this impenetrable kind of it's not nonsense but but basically he was trying to say that the purpose of language is simply to describe stuff okay and if you if you can't describe stuff then well it's pointless useless physical baggage and you can you can do away with it but you know in his latter life you know that the second wittgenstein wittgenstein version two i think his book was philosophical investigations he he he rejects what he did in the tractatus he sort of says well i was wrong

### 1h 2m

about all that because he recognized there's a whole lot of other reasons that language has for existing asking people questions comforting people um writing fiction and so on doing art and there's all these other functions of language that aren't just about describing stuff or stating facts there are other purposes for language how this escaped him the first time around i don't know but he was focused very very narrowly very narrowly on science and problems within within science and and trying to be a hard-nosed macho kind of philosopher who just wanted to get rid of the the supernatural fair enough um or discussions of of mysticism and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and political stuff fair enough to some extent fair enough okay i can understand the motivation even if i don't um agree with it um but sometimes people go too far as i like to say baby in the bath water and all that you know you you want to try and sharpen up things in philosophy but

### 1h 3m

that doesn't mean you just do away with everything just because you've managed to dissect out certain amounts of nonsense okay okay next word um david defines i'm missing a few of them but um he also defines emergence and he says an emergent phenomena is one such as life thought or computation about which there are comprehensible facts or explanations that are not simply deducible from lower level theories but which may be explicable or predictable by higher level theories referring directly to that phenomenon okay so yeah so emergence is a key part of understanding the world you need to appreciate that and and common sense realism is about this right man on the street type thinking is of course of course these things really exist okay and this is why people make fun of philosophers you know they they knock on a table and they go you know is this real kind of

### 1h 4m

thing this is real and they have long debates about whether or not the table is real man on the street looks at that and goes yeah that's ridiculous okay it's like um small brain big brain galaxy brain kind of thing you know small brain is you know like the table is real and then supposedly the big brain philosopher comes along and says well actually the table's not real because all that's there are fundamental particles and the fundamental particles are only things that really truly exist the table doesn't exist whoo of course galaxy brain then looks at that and goes well that's ridiculous okay all you're doing is um kind of thinking in the abstract now you're not really connecting with um how objects actually do exist in reality cats exist my cat happens to be sitting here today coffee mugs exist you know these emergent things exist people exist and in fact some of these

### 1h 5m

things that are emergent things are also fundamental things okay and a fundamental thing is a thing which features in the explanations of lots of other things as well i like to say people are fundamental as fundamental as fundamental particles are and one day we might consider them in a sense more fundamental than fundamental particles and we might consider them more fundamental than fundamental particles because people might be able to exist in a universe without particles okay we might be able to be instantiated in something other than particles i don't know how right now you know some sort of gravitational pattern space time or something i don't know but in order to have a person you just need a way of processing information anyway people people are this confluence of as i've already said and emphasized the theory of evolution the theory of computation quantum theory and epistemology and so we're fundamental because we appear uh in a sense across all of those it well we're not really there in quantum physics but we're certainly there in epistemology it doesn't epistemology doesn't make sense in a world in which

### 1h 6m

you don't have knowledge creators insofar as you've got evolution in the universe and there is a possibility of people arising in such a universe and if you've got people in such a universe then you've got these things that are uh computers of a client in fact you just need animals for that okay i'm starting to rant and so let me stop here for today next time we move on to chapter two shadows which is as i have said before uh probably the chapter that most affected me when i first read the fabric of reality back in 1997 because it was the the chapter that cured me of my up until then complete disillusionment with quantum physics i'd been doing quantum physics at university i didn't understand what was going on you know i sort of i could do the problems but it was like what am i doing i don't get it it doesn't make any sense to me um this is all

### 1h 7m

nonsense and i was i was reassured by lecturers that well yeah it's supposed to be nonsense it's just a bit weird just shut up and calculate so to speak and i'd read lots of popular science books and none of them really helped they all made it sound mystical until shadows until i read the fabric of reality chapter two so that's next time look forward to that it's going i would presume to be i think i'll get through it fairly quickly the reason is because i've talked about the multiverse before i've got a five or six part series up there on youtube all about the multiverse and so i'm going to be referring to that a bit so we'll be doing a a slimmed down version of chapter two of the fabric of reality shadows but until then bye
