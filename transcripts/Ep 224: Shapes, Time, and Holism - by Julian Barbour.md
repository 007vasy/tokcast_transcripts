Welcome to TopCast, and today, for a special presentation, I was fortunate to attend a lecture recently by Professor Julian Barber, who is an independent British physicist and one of the foremost experts on time, Newtonian mechanics and, well, the foundations of physics in general. He's a very original thinker who is speaking about a new theory of physics, shape dynamics. This is a technical presentation, which is unusual for TopCast, and you'll hear there are frequent interjections and questions from the audience from a number of other experts, physicists like Charlie Lineweaver, who has appeared on TopCast, and friend of the show, Sam Kuipers, and others. The audience questions and interjections are audible, and in most cases, intelligible, enough at least, but the audience obviously weren't all mic'd up, so there might be more difficult to hear. However, Julian is being properly recorded, so you can hear his answers.

### 1m

Now, after my disembodied voice here, you will hear an introduction from our disembodied Sam Kuipers, welcoming Julian to the stage, and then a disembodied Julian speaks for about a minute before we move on to the embodied video of Julian delivering his lecture. This is a wide-ranging original talk, and you can watch for the content, and you can watch for the deep knowledge Julian has of the ideas and the history of physics, and how Newton might still have a chance at being more right than what anyone else much thinks. And also, for the interactions between physicists in the audience questioning one another and Julian in an attempt to understand something that challenges the foundations of our most basic ideas about space and time and reality. So, without any more from me, here's Sam. And then Julian. Yeah, well, Julian, thanks so much for being here, it's great that you could join.

### 2m

Julian is really an expert on time, he's one of the experts on the theory of time. I first encountered Julian's work a couple of years ago, I work on time myself, and I was very pleasantly surprised to find Julian's work, which was really mind-blowing to me. His books are absolutely excellent, I cannot recommend them highly enough. I think Julian is interesting, both in that he's an advocate of the... timeless view of physics, in which time is really reduced to other, more fundamental attributes, and also because he's an immense expert on classical mechanics, on the ins and outs of Newtonian dynamics, and when I first encountered Julian's work, one of the things that really struck me was that I thought I understood Newtonian mechanics, because of course I had high school classes and things like that in physics, and then I found that really, I was very deeply mistaken about this, so that's one of the things that makes Julian's work really fascinating. And, yeah, I'm very honoured that he can give talk, he's given a warm round of applause for Julian.

### 3m

Well, thank you very much. Well, thank you, and at the bottom you see many thanks to Naval, Brett and Sam. I thought Sam, you'd suggested I should be one of the speakers, but Brett tells me he'd already decided on that, but anyway, thank you very much. So you see my title is Shapes, which is going to be very important, Time and Holism. I'm going to suggest... I'm going to suggest that we need a paradigm shift from reductionist approach to physics and science to a holistic one, where we really try and understand the whole universe. So here's me, vanity, showing my own picture. This is really to illustrate the triangles. People who've heard me talk before know I'm always illustrating my points with triangles, because a triangle is the simplest non-trivial structure, a shape. And the point... The point I really want to emphasise again and again is a triangle has a shape and a size,

### 4m

and the shape is far, far more fundamental. The size only has meaning if you've got a ruler to measure the size, and if you look at that picture there, you see the triangles are smaller than me, and I'm smaller than the room in which I was speaking, and the room was smaller than the rest of the universe, and you'll go on forever looking for something to measure the size, but it's always relative. So use nothing but ratios. I'm going to have that carved on my gravestone. I just say this. I recently had a visit from a wonderful French mathematician who came with his student, a Chinese lady, and I got her to write out in Chinese characters how they represent complexity. There's one with three symbols and one with just one symbol, and also entropy. And first of all, it was absolutely magical. To see her doing this, the ease with which she did it.

### 5m

But then the point I'd like to make is that the meaning of those symbols is completely independent of the size. If she'd written them twice as large, they'd still have exactly the same meaning. And I'm coming to think that meaning is scale invariant. And also I would say my talk will really be about three-dimensional scale invariance, and I would assert that it's an... understudied symmetry. It's been neglected. And also though, so this is about holism. So that meaning is encoded in a whole. This is... There was a book came out in which there's a chapter from me, It from Bit, that's John Wheeler's aphorism. And I argue that it's bit from it without having the whole story. You can't identify. A bit. You've got to have that structure there. And the German word for shape is Gestalt.

### 6m

And in Gestalt psychology, that's an organized whole perceived as more than the sum of its parts. And the attributes are not of the whole are not deducible from the parts in isolation. And I think I'll be able to illustrate that in Newtonian gravity. Now I got into all of this quite by chance. Reading a popular science article about work that Dirac had done in 1958, which was reflected in a book which he published a very little book lectures on quantum mechanics, which is very important in gauge theory and is a very much cited little book in papers on gauge theory. And in that... So what Dirac had did he had instead of looking at general relativity as a space-time theory, he'd looked at it. This is a dynamical Hamiltonian theory. And he'd come to the conclusion that arbitrary slicing of space-time to define simultaneity.

### 7m

It was just introducing unnecessary complications and redundant degrees of freedom. And that that was from the point of view of a quantum theory of gravity was anathema to him. So he has this statement which he puts in italic. I am inclined to believe four-dimensional symmetry is not a fundamental property of. The physical world. I read that one day one evening and the next morning. I woke up and said to myself. Well, if Dirac says that what is time that was 61 years ago, and I'm still working on that problem. So that's the background to me. Sorry. What is four-dimensional symmetry here? What does he mean by that? The notion of space-time starting with Minkowski space-time, which has a photo. But the thing is that you can in general relativity. You can foliate. You can get Cauchy surfaces, which slice four-dimensional space-time in any way. You'd like as long as it remains space-like.

### 8m

And he said that that's a mistake. You should restore and in fact, actually, when you go into the structure of general relativity, the most economic way that uses the least information is to replace the idea of space-time just by a succession of shapes of. Three-dimensional shapes. And that's I've been involved in that work. And it is closely related to a very fundamental property in general relativity. How you solve its initial value problem. So. So then very soon after that, I came across works of Ernst Mach where he says it is utterly impossible to measure the changes of things. By time, quite the common country. Time is an abstraction at which we arrive by means of the changes of things.

### 9m

Now that's realized in what's called Ephemeris time by the astronomers. So in the 1890s, the astronomers detected an anomalous acceleration of the moon. The moon was further ahead in its position on the sky than it should be according to Newton's laws and the assumption that the rotation of the Earth. Is a good clock. So they then and there was a rival theory that at eclipses of the moon. The sun's gravitational force was absorbed by the Earth. So the moon didn't feel such a strong gravitational force. That was only disproved in 1937 when it was shown when a British astronomer real showed that all the planets exhibited this thing. So it couldn't be anything to do with the the Earth. Absorbing the things but they what the astronomers decided was that instead of using Newtonian theory with Newton's absolute time to predict where the planets would be.

### 10m

They assumed that there would be something like Newtonian time above all one which would conserve the total energy of the solar system and they would use the position of the moon. Essentially. They were just using the Sun Earth and moon. They would use the position. Of the moon to say what is the time and that they called ephemeris time. And it involves all the elements in the system. And this is why I have some discussion with with Sam about this idea of page water where you take one degree of freedom as a to tell the time for the rest of the ones. I think they are all I would argue that they're all in involved together. So so much for for that for the moment. Now marks conjecture otherwise was the origin of inertial frames of reference which is the modern way of talking about absolute space and time.

### 11m

And. When I don't know if people here might reflect on this most students when they're taught dynamics in their first year at the university. They're told Newton's laws in an inertial frame of reference. If any. Of them is a cheek is to ask the lecture what's an inertial frame of reference and where does it come from they'll probably be told it's one in which Newton's laws hold. That's not an explanation. And must conjecture was that the relative positions and motions of all the bodies in the universe determine the local inertial frames of reference in which Newton's laws of motion hold and that. That's come in that form it's also called marks principle but I don't want to get into Einstein's coining of marks principle and I have to say Einstein made a terrible mess of trying to sort out marks principle.

### 12m

He did other things absolutely wonderfully but not that. And this is realized I'll show how it's realized in Newtonian gravity but it is also realized in general relativity through elliptical equations. So if you look at the So this is in a book by my collaborator Flavia McCarthy shaped dynamics where all of that if any of you want to look at that it's published by Oxford University. Let your press a few years ago. Now I want to talk about I want to introduce the notion of intrinsic shape dynamics so Newton introduced the notions of absolute time space and implicitly with absolute space a notion of absolute scale and I would say that's the most pernicious aspect of it all.

### 13m

So let's let's suppose we have particles with masses mi one to n and their Cartesian coordinates ri. Now they will have these observable separations are I J that you see in the middle there sorry at the top and but that presupposes an extrinsic absolute scale to say what those separations are you can't do that without a ruler and that I think is just amazingly often forgotten forgotten. Now you can you can rectify that problem by making things easier. It's dimensionless so there is an extrinsic scale in Newtonian theory and it's the root means square length and if the particles all have equal mass.

### 14m

It's it's the one on the on the left up there and if you add the masses mass weighting where capital M is the total mass that makes it that's something pure it's a pure number it's dimensionless and then you can you introduce then what I call the intrinsic separations. Those are pure numbers, and everything should be pure and should be ratios. And you can do this even if there's infinitely many particles in an infinite space, and we're working on that. It would be too complicated for me to go into that. So now I'm a bit influenced here by Poincaré's writing on this. Poincaré says we should take Newton's second law, but he too was very doubtful about absolute space and times like that. So the question is, keeping the essence of Newton's second law,

### 15m

which is the relationship, how forces change motions, can we seek a Newtonian evolution of these intrinsic separations, not the absolute ones? And the answer is we can, but the key thing is, let me start off, so I'm going to start by defining what I call undeniable difference. Suppose we have one shape, Rij, and then there's another shape which is slightly different. So I add a little bit more of those things, and these are the r-bars, the intrinsic, these are the intrinsic separations, and as yet, there's no criterion for a time order in that. So the question is, and this is derived from Poincaré, but I go, at least one or two steps further than Poincaré, can two such shapes define an evolution of the shapes from then on, uniquely, is that? Then you would say that that's a wonderfully predictive theory, if it can do that.

### 16m

Now, Newton's law, Newton's theory as it stands, can't do that, because the way I put it is, he contaminated his own greatest discovery, which was the second law, and the gravitational law, because, first of all, absolute time allows you to assume different amounts of infinitesimal time passed between those two intrinsic shapes. So, and that means that you can imagine an arbitrary amount of kinetic energy being associated with those two shapes. So there's an arbitrary element coming into it. Newton's law, Newton's theory, is absolute time. Now, there are various ways to get rid of that problem. The most obvious one is to say, well, there's only one value of the energy which is distinguished,

### 17m

which is that the energy is exactly zero. And you can argue for that by what's called the principle of sufficient reason. But there's another reason, another argument, is that you can get rid of time altogether, and you just say that there are successions of shape, and you have a shape space this is with this is with scale by the way you have a shape space space of positive space of possible configurations and you define a geodesic principle in in that space which is not involving time at all and then then you can define so that's the simplest possible law you can get it's a geodesic law and and you can you then can choose you can then imagine that that that evolution unfolds at a certain rate which makes Newton's laws hold and energy conserved and that's a convention but in fact the all the reality is in the successive configurations it's not in the it's not in the rate at which they

### 18m

follow each other so that's there so that's the first thing so that's the contamination with we get rid of the contamination with we get rid of the contamination due to absolute time by saying the energy of the whole universe that I'm consisting of a finite number of particles must be exactly zero now the same thing is to introduce arbitrary orientation between the two here's my one shape and here's my other one that's slightly different I can imagine this is oriented in absolute space relative to that it won't change either of the shapes that thing there but I'm putting actually effectively angular momentum into the initial data when I do that so that's that's strength of for Bolton as the Germans would say you mustn't do that sort of thing so the only way to get around that well people who know my work on best matching best matching says the angular momentum must be zero and that again would follow from the principle of sufficient reason only vanishing angular momentum is is distinguished

### 19m

well Leibniz said any definite observable fact Simon can perhaps put it sharper more than me must have an explanation. Any observable fact must have an explanation. Would you agree, Simon? Something along those lines. Yeah, yeah. And it's the supreme confidence of the rationalist. And if you think Leibniz was a bit over the top, Gödel said Leibniz was by far the best thinker on this, far superior to Spinoza, according to Gödel. So I think there's good reason to take that seriously. It's the supreme rationalist standpoint that there must be an explanation for something you can see. Not necessarily. In fact, I will give you examples

### 20m

where there's an explanation for a structure which is not due to something that's happened in the past. That it's just an instantaneous explanation. Is Voltaire's Candide, does it make fun of this principle? Think upon? Does Voltaire's Candide make fun of this principle? Oh, absolutely, yes. Now, Leibniz actually, Leibniz said the world, the universe should be, he believed that variety, without variety we could say nothing. Therefore, in the best of all possible worlds there should be more variety than anything else. And then he, when he was talking, when he was talking to princesses, he said this is the best of all possible worlds. So that's, but really he was saying it's the most varied. But a better characterization of his philosophy, which I'll come to, is that the universe is striving to become ever more varied. And I'll show you exactly how that comes straight out of Newtonian theory when you've got rid of all his contamination

### 21m

of his own wonderful theory. Now, now we come to scale. And this is where things get, for me, extremely interesting. And it's a very recent development in the work I've been doing with collaborators. Now, you can also put an arbitrary scale difference between these two shapes. And say one is larger than the other. And that would be measured by something which is analog of the angular momentum, but instead of a cross product, it's a dot product. So that's what I call the dilatation of momentum. Now, here's an interesting thing. That quantity d plays a very fundamental role in, in celestial mechanics and among n-body specialists. Amazingly, I was the first person to give it a name in 2003 and call it the dilatational momentum. So that's quite an interesting fact of these things. And just as there was some talk of the Riemann hypothesis, who knows about Michael Berry's work on the Riemann hypothesis?

### 22m

Michael Berry has found a way of finding a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, which seems to, whose eigenvalues are very close, reproduces a lot of the zeros. And I was talking about this in Bristol, this stuff, showing my dilatational momentum. And Michael came up and said, by the way, my work is based on that. It's just the dilatational momentum of a single particle in a plane. So that's quite an interesting fact. Now, there's all sorts of problems with saying that I want to have the dilatational momentum zero, but it's not necessarily. First of all, it's not conserved by Newtonian force. The Newtonian gravitational potential is homogeneous to the degree minus one, and you need one of degree minus two to ensure conservation of that condition. So there are other problems, but let me point out that the,

### 23m

so I explored that possibility just over 20 years ago, but then abandoned it, and it wasn't working. I might have missed this, but everything is referenced to the center of mass. Oh yes, yes, center of mass, yes. So this best matching idea of mine brings the centers of mass to coincidence and the angular momentum to zero, yeah. And if you want to, you can bring the dilatational momentum to zero as well. But then we might have time to talk about that later. So where do we go from here? And this has come really, in the last year or two. So the solutions with energy and angular momentum exactly zero, these are solutions that in normal Newtonian terms are a set of measure zero. So now the question is, is there an even smaller set of measure zero within the set of measure zero

### 24m

which actually gets rid of this problem of absolute scale? When you say it's a set of measure zero, what is it? is the set within which it is a set of measures? All the ones that start with arbitrary initial data as specified when n-body people write down the equations so they can have arbitrary energy, arbitrary angular momentum, arbitrary momentum but that's trivial. So basically it's you're instead of allowing initial data which have energy and angular momentum non-vanishing you're saying only the ones that have vanishing things. So that's the set of measure zero I think you would agree. So now the question is is there just possibly a set of measure zero within that already tiny subset? And the answer is yes there is and that goes back to the most what most people regard as the most

### 25m

fundamental principle in dynamics the principle of least action. Now I'm suggesting that the principle of least action is too restrictive because in the principle of least action you require to specify an initial configuration. Normally there's a length of time but it doesn't have, in a geodesic principle it doesn't have to be a length of time but then there has to be another configuration and those two configurations will have different scales. There will be a ratio of scales and to say there's a ratio of scales you've got to have a ruler at one end and a ruler at the other end. But that's introducing absolute scales into the story and now the interesting thing is this means that the principle of least action can't give you solutions if the scale, the root means square length, the external scale, the extrinsic scale is either zero or infinity at one of

### 26m

the ends because then you can't form a proper ratio between zero or infinity and a finite number. So then the question is are the Newtonian solutions for which the external, the extrinsic scale is either zero or infinity at one end because then they can't be found by the principle of least action but if they're Newtonian solutions they are Newtonian solutions with his second law as we shall see, not over the whole length but they would be very interesting solutions and amazingly they were discovered. The first person who discovered it was somebody called Carl Suntmann in 1907. So Carl Suntmann asked, he said, I think I'm the first person to ask this question, in the three body problem are there solutions

### 27m

are there situations into which three point particles of arbitrary masses but they can be equal mass can collide simultaneously at a point at their centre of mass and he showed they can and it's absolutely fabulous mathematics I don't think there's anything remotely like that mathematics in attempts to treat general relativity right at its big bang so he showed they could now he showed that and that would be that the root means square length must be zero the extrinsic scale must be zero and he also showed that the angular momentum must be zero and in the case of the three body problem he showed that the limiting shape as they come to collide the shape must become ever more perfectly either equilateral or be collinear and and that

### 28m

so when you reverse when you time reverse those although Suntmann didn't think of doing that and I think I might be the first person who suggested you should do that if that's time reverse that's a Newtonian big bang from on the face of it what looks like all the particles sitting on a point but in reality for shall we say if the shape can be aware of itself the shape is aware of starting as an equilateral triangle you mentioned in answer to Simon's question you said that your vectors r were defined at the centre of mass yes I'm referring sorry yes it all should be relative to the centre well no that's a simplification it's not essential but it's a simplification the reason I'm asking is because is your Newtonian big bang in a specific position because in general it's not no no no equilateral triangle an equilateral triangle is a concept in my brain as well as yours and it can be anywhere you like it doesn't have any position

### 29m

it's just a shape I mean yesterday I said big bang is everywhere in his room now what about this Newtonian big bang was that in his room no no no it's just it's just an equilateral triangle period nothing more than that nothing less it's just pure mathematics it's an equilateral triangle well we'll come to the sense in which they get in which you can say that the universe is expanding but it's not in the sense that the that in with respect to an external scale it's with respect to an intrinsic scale which I'm going to introduce it doesn't doesn't I mean

### 30m

well that to say they're arbitrarily small you've got to have an external ruler then you can say it's arbitrarily small if you haven't got that external ruler if if so to speak each vertex of the triangle could see it's the other two vertices all it would see is the angle to them L rms equals zero doesn't that mean it's a point with an extrinsic scale I haven't yet got to the intrinsic scale which clarifies these things no no no thank you sorry don't take it that I'm taking offense when you press me but that's very important because I'm obviously not getting things across clearly but this is this is a huge I would say it's a huge neglected symmetry I'm going to quote to you in a minute later on a passage from Poincaré which is fun there so

### 31m

very so only a year later somebody called I forget what his name but within a year somebody had shown that this could also happen for an arbitrary number of particles they could all collide at a point and in all cases the energy the angular momentum had to be zero the energy could be anything and then in 1922 at the latest I'm not quite sure so by the way the time reverse then you turn in big bangs and this is two decades before Hubble's discovery yeah I don't understand why it's not the obvious these statements that you know I throw a ball up and it comes back down and it hits the earth two particles and they collide what's the you're sort of enchanted by well the thing is with two particles don't define a shape and so with three particles just by a simple symmetry argument sorry by a simple symmetry argument

### 32m

if I have you know when you told me that they would collide I'd say well yeah it's an equilateral triangle and there's no angular momentum of course they're going to collide it doesn't seem well by the way the shapes if they miss they're going to miss in a certain direction that would break the symmetry that may well be but the what is much more interesting than the equilateral triangle which is what I'll come onto is when there's many more particles and then the shapes are really very interesting as I hope you'll see so the reason so your objection was that there's why not two particles is that right no I was just I was confused as to why it took until 1907 to show that three particles or even you know n particles in a range symmetrically you know falling towards each other they have to collide that seems sort of obvious that

### 33m

that yes that would be but in fact you'll see it gets much more interesting when we get up to about a few more particles than just three or four I mean the regular tetrahedron is very similar to the equilateral triangle sorry they can have any mass so the it's with arbitrary masses yeah that makes it non that makes it non-trivial yes yes and the same goes thank you very much the same goes for the regular tetrahedron it's the but that's restricted to there by the way these results were anticipated by Lagrange in 1772 but that'll take me a bit away from things yes

### 34m

so there's two types of solutions right sorry there's two solutions either equilateral triangle or collinear yes and by the way the collinear is is the ultimately it's the explanation of where the James Webb telescope is sitting and that was discovered by Euler in 1663 the possibility of the James Webb telescope it goes back to Euler around 1663 1763 sorry okay so if I'll go on now if I may but do ask questions at the latest by 1922 but it may well have been earlier Jean Chazy a very brilliant French mathematician who's the one in the middle showed that three or more particles can get to infinity and be at rest when they get there that's the analog of just

### 35m

escape in two particles a particle escaping from the earth but in both cases now this is where it gets interesting the final shape in both cases is very special so the so the the parabolic escape where they all get to infinity the energy must be zero the angular momentum can be anything so that's sort of dual to the total collision and in both cases the final shape must be special now I'll come to that now so now I introduce the concept of shape complexity so I introduce this as follows suppose just a finite number of particles let's suppose they're equal mass particles in Euclidean space and you want a pure number a dimensionless number which characterizes the extent to which they are uniformly distributed or

### 36m

clustered and if it's going to be scale invariant it's the simplest way to achieve that there are other ways but anyway whatever it is the expression must have in length must have length dimension zero so the easiest way that is to take a ratio of two lengths and then immediately two lengths stand out I've already introduced the root mean square length which is dominated by the large separations but the other one you can use is the mean harmonic length and that's in the first equation there it's the it's the inverse of the Newton gravitational potential with the sign reversed rather interestingly so what we call the shape complexity is the root mean square length divided by the mean harmonic length and for the case of equal mass you see the expression for it there and mass weighting

### 37m

is obvious now I think it's very remarkable so Leibniz was obsessed with there being variety I was on the lookout for a quantity which characterized variety and came across this quantity which has long been used for thirty years or forty years at least in n-body theory which they call the shape potential or the normalized Newton potential it's just that it's just the ratio of the two numbers that really does govern the Newtonian theory and in some senses it's that product of the two that dimensionless number as I will explain that really does govern the whole of Newtonian n-body problem when you've not allowed any contamination by absolute elements and so you'll see that it's all very holistic so the total collision and parabolic escape solutions always

### 38m

end at a minimum or saddle of the shape complexity and as yet n-body specialists have found no way to continue the solutions beyond these points total collisions they can be continued but there's no unique way to do it there's infinitely many ways that you can continue it it's because in fact there's a an essential singularity in the theory at that point there and then the other thing which shows how important shape is in all this for this to happen the solution the solution trajectory in shape space so shape space is the space of all possible shapes with a given number of particles it has a landscape on it which is defined by this shape complexity there's an altitude on it and they can only get to if the basically except if the particles are all equal mass

### 39m

they these solutions can only get either to parabolic escape or total collision if they approach that minimum or saddle along eigenvectors of the Hessian of the shape potential the determinant of the second derivatives and the great bulk of them go along come in or go out along the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue so that's a fact of how really Newtonian dynamics properly understood is about scale invariant quantities and completely impossible to understand its subtleties without now the the yes I've got it oh yes now I'll tell you about central configurations so central yes before going there is it possible

### 40m

to know two different shapes with shape complexity sorry given any distribution of particles and their masses or their mass ratios which is all that counts the shape complexity is uniquely determined yeah I would like if it's possible if not like um how can I imagine one shape being more complex than another according to this measure if they have the same number if there are the same numbers of particles with the same mass ratios then that number just tells you it there's a given number of particles with given mass ratios that defines what I call shape space and shape space is foliated by values of the complexity yeah that makes sense

### 41m

mathematically yeah I would like to have this more of a deep historial intuition of what complexity means here in the sense that can you say that if an equilateral triangle of equal masses is more complex or is it less complex than an isosceles triangle it's less complex the equilateral triangle for all for any mass ratios is the minimum it's the absolute minimum of the complexity the minute you get either isosceles or scalene the complexity goes up and as it gets more and more scalene and more and more two particles relatively closer to the other it goes unbounded there are infinite peaks of the complexity ok are these flat triangles or are they in the three body problem if the angular

### 42m

momentum is zero they must be it's planar that was proved by a German called Jobbeck in about 1880 I think just to have a bit more so then if n equals 4 if I have a configuration that is not co-planar then the shape complexity is higher I guess so I mean by the way I'm coming on to central configurations which is a topic of very considerable it's a major unsolved problem in mathematics to do with how many of these things there are so let me come on to them perhaps if I may so so a central configuration which was also coined by that German I mentioned just now Jobbeck in 1899 a central configuration is one where the net gravitational force acting on each particle exerted by all the other

### 43m

particles points exactly to the centre of mass of the complete system and with a strength that increases linearly with the distance from it so one way of thinking about a central configuration is that if if you held the particles at rest in that they would then fall under gravity until they all collide together so that's one definition of a central configuration but it's better to think of it as a relative as a relative equilibrium because you can balance those gravitational forces by repulsive hook forces and that's the way there's a lot of discussion about that relative equilibrium and in two dimensions the forces can be balanced by centrifugal force and that's actually behind the theory of the James Webb telescope where it's sitting and also very incredibly beautifully

it's behind Saturn's rings Saturn's rings are a central configuration and one more thing after J.J. Thompson had discovered the electron and before Rutherford had done his scattering experiments with alpha particles his main effort to explain atomic structure was with central things like central configurations relative equilibrium so there's quite a pass back there and my wildest guess is that maybe Thompson was onto the right thing quantum mechanics might just not be right anyway so there's a very good article on central configurations in Wikipedia at the moment the Lagrange points and Saturn's rings and as I say central configurations are critical points minima or saddles of the shape complexity and just give me a set of particles with their mass ratios

### 45m

and that completely determines all the central configurations that they can have and another thing which is very interesting about them there's a huge number of them they're essentially if they're collinear ones you can immediately show they're factorial in number so it's an unknown they may be infinite in number but they're certainly factorial in number so this is just huge number of shapes and I'll show you some incredibly rich structures that they form in a moment or two and it's clearly a very holistic concept because it's it's just determined by the mass ratios and the mass ratios determine the relative separations between the particles so the complexity has many roles, first of all it measures complexity or variety as I've just described now the interesting thing is it's a scale invariant potential energy because that's what it is a potential energy, it's a

### 46m

product of two potential energies and it is that and as we will see the critical points are very special structures, I've already mentioned that in the three and four body problems but it's an intrinsic scale now I'm going to contrast an extrinsic absolute scale with an intrinsic scale because the shape complexity is the root mean square length divided by the mean harmonic length and the large separations dominate the root mean square length and the small ones dominate the mean harmonic length so if I want to measure a long interval I take a short interval and see how many times it goes into it so basically if you want to say you're talking about the size of the universe in intrinsic terms or at least of a Newtonian universe of a finite number of particles it is the quantity to choose is precisely the shape complexity

### 47m

that is an intrinsic scale and so I think that's pretty interesting and now the other thing is the intrinsic scale and the extrinsic scale can behave very very differently and they do this particularly at the big bangs in this Newtonian theory because the extrinsic scale goes to zero but the intrinsic scale goes to a finite value it's the absolute minimum the shape complexity is a positive definite number and it has an absolute minimum which is by the way the most uniform shape that the universe can have of those particles so it goes there and I'm now going to show that this quantity defines the direction of time and I think casts huge doubt on a lot of talk about entropy of the universe and what is really determining the arrow of time the experienced arrow of time

### 48m

let me just tell you about that so this is a paper that was published ten years ago by Flavia McCarthy, Tim Koslowski and myself and basically first of all I'll tell you about a Janus point which is not where there's a total collision Lagrange in 1772 showed that in the three body problem in the infinite if the energy is non-negative either zero or positive but also in fact effectively in many cases if it's negative as well in the infinite power the size is infinitely great the root means square length comes down monotonically to a finite value and then increases monotonically to infinity and that existence of that Janus point of minimum size I call it a Janus point because if the Roman god stood there he would see the size increasing in both directions

### 49m

and that defines bidirectional arrows of time and that unique point there there's nothing whatever to do with me putting in by hand the existence of that point it's there as a direct consequence of Newton's law it's a two line proof which relies on Newton's second law the fact that the Newton potential is homogeneous a degree minus one and is negative definite and it's a two line proof and Lagrange found it there but that's not something that creatures within such a universe can see because they don't have an external ruler what they see is what the universe looks like what it looks like at that near that minimum the Janus point minimum it's like a swarm of bees it's typically the most uniform distribution in the whole history of that solution and random and pretty good approximation to

### 50m

thermal velocity what do you mean by most uniform what's the measure of uniformity it's not precisely this quantity the complexity has its minimum value not exactly at that point except by fortuitously it's in the vicinity of it I'm just thinking this through that C is scale and variance you've already said it 20 times it isn't how compact or spread out it is it's something a little bit harder for me to it's in the shape it requires I'm just curious if you were just to draw a shape with high C and low C what would those shapes look like well the simplest one is the low C is the equilateral triangle and the high C is one where there's one point here and the two others are very close to each other compared with the distance there very isosceles yes very isosceles

### 51m

or very pointed like a Jackson Pollock like it's a Jackson Pollock painting high C and I'm joking a little bit but I'm trying to translate that notion of complexity into something that's a little more comprehension sorry does it have to do with complexity is it more less complex than spiky sorry I didn't catch one word yeah sure so if I have n particles in a plane that's focused on planes and I have a convex polygon yeah is that less complex than a polygon where it's like a star almost certainly I'd have guessed but without actually doing the calculation I wouldn't like to stick my neck out but the good thing about this is there's absolutely no shadow of doubt

### 52m

about it either it's a central the complexity is just fixed once and for all come on I understand that I'm just trying to imagine it but then the thing is as you go away from the Janus point in this picture subsystems form so the total universe has vanishing angular momentum and in Dirac's term it's described by constrained Hamiltonian dynamics when you get out little subsystems form isolated and above all they can be Kepler pairs that divide each other and as you go further and further away from the Janus point it gets ever more ordered and regular so you get a whole host of two particle systems which each in themselves are rods, clocks and compasses describing and they're all mutually synchronised they're not the same periods

### 53m

but the ratios of the periods tend to be ever more constant ratios of these things like that so as you go out you go out from chaos to order this is the exact opposite of entropic effect as the way one normally thinks about it what's the x-axis on the plot the x-axis could be time could be time yes it could be time yeah the idea is just that the complexity increases like that and it's purely dynamical it increases it with respect to some variable yes or the variable is probably time well you could I could introduce ephemeris time I mean it would increase relative to ephemeris time that quantity that I mentioned earlier and in fact my collaborator in California Hemant Shukla has done these things where he's plotted

### 54m

the growth of the complexity against ephemeris time and it starts with the complexity up with the same slope from then on but we're not to imagine that Jan's point is in a point in space is that right no no it's a relative point it's a it corresponds to a special shape no sorry that's not quite true the minimum of the complexity is a special shape now in the diagram the second diagram you had something spread out and then something compact and something spread out are those can we say that the Jan's point is in some sense smaller than the spread out thing or what is the scale of the distance here that is spread out in the the it's spread out in terms of what what so to speak creatures within the universe can see so when you when you look at the when you see stars

### 55m

on the sky the sky is always whatever it is for what's the area of the four pi isn't it the sky is always exactly the same size it is just a question of whether the stars are more clustered together on the sky you can imagine the same four pi sky that's a dimensionless number a four pi sky and you could have stars very uniformly distributed all over the sky or they could be clustered in like we see in constellations so could you have drawn that second panel with a larger thing in the middle that's that has no significance it's scale invariant I mean it would just look it would just be misleading I think to show that point that things coming together that's sort of misleading right you could have shown those three figures with the little b swarm is exactly the same size on the screen sorry is this

### 56m

an earlier slide or the slide here oh yes sorry yes no all every size that you see is purely nominal what is not nominal is that the what is not nominal or arbitrary is that sorry that one of these things is bigger than than that because there's a ratio there's a meaningful ratio in that size there that is meaningful but to say but overall it's scale invariant it goes back to what I was saying about the Chinese characters their meaning does not depend upon their size I think I think what Charlie is objecting to maybe or reacting to is that that swarm of bees in the in the center there looks smaller on the screen than the two yeah no this is unfortunate yes yes no that's a good very unfortunate unfortunately it's now called an iconic diagram

### 57m

but it's it's no no I mean this is it's just excuse me I'm going to can you get my thing I'm just going to read you something of Poincare at this stage because I think it's too good to miss this part of the lecture you what Poincare has to be cited at this juncture of the lecture yeah what aren't the because you're doing some kind of it's equivalent yeah that's a good equivalence class yeah yeah you can imagine natural space and you have the configuration somewhere if you have the same configuration elsewhere so you have a sense of math that's in place then you have the equivalence class of all those spaces so you can kind of quotient out the underlying absolute space so that nothing depends on it then you're only looking at intrinsic attributes in the opposite three-dimensional space so this is from Poincare's science

and science and method about 1908 published suppose that in one night all the dimensions of the universe became a thousand times larger the world will remain similar to itself if we give the word similitude the meaning it has in the third book of Euclid only what was formerly a metre long will now measure a kilometre and what was a millimetre long will become a metre the bed in which I went to sleep and my body itself will have grown in the same proportion when I wake in the morning what will be my feeling in the face of such an astonishing transformation well I shall not notice anything at all that's not what J.B.S. Haldane said about this it's a well known biological problem that things are scaled well that's maybe because the earth sets a scale it's like

### 59m

it's micro thermodynamics and statistical mechanics in a box and the gravitational force sets that's the main constraint on for example the shapes of animals like a fly or an elephant are not independent of the gravitational field in which they live that's right but by the way the the in the actually in the Newtonian n-body problem the gravitational constant really doesn't appear in it at all it's all about mass ratios and in fact the gravitational constant is a constant it came in when Cavendish wanted to work out how much mass there was in the earth compared with in say Ben Nevis or something like yes but that's to do to the mass ratios because the everything I mean Newton is all

### 1h 0m

in terms of mass ratios it's all in terms of mass ratios that the there isn't really a gravitational constant it's just a convenient way of thinking about things where did I put that point oh it's here comment I want I mean first of all it's very entertaining that passage in Poincaré but the other thing which is amazing here's one of the greatest mathematicians of all time he never did anything about it he didn't look for something which is scale invariant not to my knowledge and lo and behold it had already been it was just in the very year that book was published the quantity that is significant was appearing in that

### 1h 1m

work by Suntman no connection to his recurrence theory no no because the recurrence theory requires this is the key thing this is why I'm very skeptical about all talk of entropy associated with the whole universe so entropy is meaningful if the solutions of your dynamical system only explore a phase space of bounded measure this is made absolutely clear by Gibbs in his book he says if the system I'm considering can explore infinite space or the momenta can grow without bound everything I say becomes meaningless because I can't define probabilities meaningfully and very few people notice that and the thing is that the first and oldest dynamical theory has an unbounded Liouville phase space in the normal way you think about it that's the Newtonian n-body problem because the root means square length and it becomes infinite and there is a complete

### 1h 2m

theory of statistics in that case which my collaborators and I are so far as I know the first person people who are exploring it has never been done before and people just have been completely unaware of its existence Do you know if this is linked with the notions of entropy as a measure of information for infinite dimensional systems that's beyond my pay grade I would say sorry say it so I come from information theory and you have the Shannon information measure and that is related to entropy in the quantum mechanical can I immediately come in with one point it's of course only a finite number of characters in the alphabet so that's the bound that's essentially your box in which your system is there I agree however there have been attempts to define

### 1h 3m

entropy in the same way as Shannon defines it for finite dimensional systems for infinite dimensional systems well I'm not aware well perhaps we might talk about that that's why I was asking if you yes no I'm unaware of that all I will say is there's been an incredible neglect of when the system can explore an unbounded phase space and it all goes back to I think it's just historical inertia thermodynamics was discovered through the study of steam engines if the steam escapes from the cylinder the steam engine stops and apart Boltzmann questioned whether the in his famous debate with Zermelo is does the universe have a bounded phase space hmm Zermelo in 1896 but after that I'm going to stick my neck out and say I think I'm the first person who really stuck my neck out and said is the universe in a box is that the

### 1h 4m

right way to think about these things and I get more and more hopeful that it's the wrong way thinking that it may be the wrong way thinking that it's the wrong way thinking about the yes I'm not quite sure I'm not quite sure whether that's really the right way to do it kosher conceptually we don't think about it that way but we have like some tools have been developed to treat space time using compactification I'm aware of that work and I've never sort of looked at it from this sort of perspective but and I mean I have twice spoken in

### 1h 5m

a seminar in front of Roger and pointed out that this special point the Janus point not even the big bang things that they're there of dynamical necessity and Roger just says no you're putting them in there by hand so you can't win on those terms Well yeah but then then he suddenly says the scale changes and I my original draft when I was asked to review his book I said this smacks of the divine intervention and then I changed it to stretch his credulity and yeah go on I have a question of course how do you define subsystems what how do you define subsystems by when in the Newtonian n-body problem as they become ever better you can describe them ever better by Newtonian gravity in an

### 1h 6m

inertial frame of reference in which they have a avaiti to ever better accuracy energy angular momentum and momentum that are conserved okay yeah I'm not that that that that that comes straight I mean I'm seeing beautiful it this man who works with me in California he's doing numerical stuff it comes out just just like that I was just curious if it was something like you select the group of particles that locally they have angular momentum zero or or they could be those 900 or so with the great velocity or whether you're doing that or something like that then you know that this is a good idea of a approach well it's not a practical sides thing it's a fundamental logic but yeah there's a number of parameters that are there that's what the key is that's what we do that's what the central design group does that's what the central design group does but of all of the subsystems must add up to zero and the energies you know in a shape I mean in these shapes you've drawn here for example some points are sort of nearer to the edge of the shape than others is that fair yes yes

### 1h 7m

I mean they're further from this I mean the center of mass is always well defined in the shape if you know the masses yes so why does the universe look homogenous in every direction well I don't know whether we'll get on to that this evening but I think the other thing I think is there's something incredibly special about the one upon our forces we were talking about this before and three dimension of space the only the only circumstances under which the Newton potential theorem holds that the if you have a spherically symmetric distribution of mass a body outside it feels a force as if it was all concentrated at the center and a body that's within it is is feels only the mouse that's within that radius and that is unique to three dimensional dimensions and the one upon our square force law and I'm coming to think that

### 1h 8m

this may tell us real and perfect that this can't be a constant law. an awful lot about the universe and and actually lead possibly to the holy grail of cosmology which is to show that the cosmological principle should be satisfied that take a large enough region you will you will find the cosmological principle holds but why do we happen to be i mean why do we happen to be at a point in the shape like we're at some point in this shape right well let me go on to one or two more slides because because because they ah so this is just to show my collaborator Tim Koslowski you'll be seeing this Simon i have a very special desk and that's that that's my study there and we call it mission control or i call it mission now a friend of mine called it mission

### 1h 9m

control so here's an early stage of a four particle big bang this i was talking about this man in california so this would have started off close to a regular tetrahedron and it's four particles and you see um very soon a kepler pair forms and two particles go off and one of them goes off so fast that it's out of the picture sorry wait a minute it's it's out of the picture up there whereas this one is here relative to the kepler pair and that that system there and and hemant in in california is is getting results like this with he starts with 50 particles and he gets 11 kepler pairs and in one case he got remarkably stable three-body system with one particle threading a a kepler pair

### 1h 10m

and and so you you see there that is the exact opposite of entropic behavior it's it's it's very chaotic motion at the start and that's all a direct consequence of newton's laws there's no past hypothesis of explaining the second law of thermodynamics i mean feinman was the first person who said to understand the second law of thermodynamics we have to add something which is not in the laws of nature that there was a very special state in the past and then david albert at in new york california columbia university called that the past hypothesis that's absolutely not necessary in newtonian theory and i strongly suspect i think it's a big question mark whether it holds in general relativity as well because in many ways general newtonian theory does so well matches so well general relativity it seems to me that that doesn't make sense because we do not have a relationship we

### 1h 11m

down, like those two pairs, they're getting tighter. As those other two points go away, they're getting tighter. And so the question is, is that increasing entropy or decreasing entropy? But you need a definition of entropy in terms of gravitational collapse, which you don't have unless you just want to say it's black hole entropy. I think perhaps, why don't we talk about that after, because otherwise, because I think if we're not going to be thrown out, let's press on a little bit. But there. Yeah, no, no, go on. No, no, go on. Do you have strong numerical results that this is an expected behavior, that if you start from a stable configuration, at least some of the particles Sorry, if you do what, if you start from From a decahedron or like one of these By the way, you can't start from a central configuration. This is very interesting. This is going to, this inverts ideas about causality, by the way.

### 1h 12m

So it's nothing if not radical, these things. But sorry, what was your question? Yeah, sure. But if I understood you correctly, you said in this slide the initial configuration was a very low genus shape. It was close to a tetrahedron, a regular tetrahedron. Yeah, yeah. So what I'm saying is, is this an expected behavior? If you are close to one of these central configurations, that one, the subset of the particles would zoom off with respect to the other. There will always, so this is another result of if the energy is non-negative, the root mean square length will always grow to infinity. That's proven, that was proven by Lagrange. So there will always be at least one particle that escapes to infinity. That's been known since Lagrange's paper in 1772. Could you point out where,

### 1h 13m

sorry? Could you point out where the initial tetrahedron was? No. Anyway, I mean, he's just given me these things and you can't actually, I'll go on to why you can't actually start it at a tetrahedron going out along one of the eigenvectors. It's because there's an essential singularity in the data. There isn't a proper Cauchy initial data for these things. So, in fact, what you've got only becomes clear afterwards. As the solution develops. Let me, perhaps I go on if that's okay. So, next one. Ah, let me now show, so the complexity is positive definite and in virtually all cases it has a unique minimum. And in three dimensions, uniquely in three dimensions, it's incredibly uniform and spherical if you have a large number. So, this is the,

### 1h 14m

the central configuration, what I call alpha. It won't be exact, the exact minimum because that's there, but it's very, very close to the absolute minimum. This is one of 5,000 particles. And you see, and there's a section on the right is a section through it. And you see that basically it's a very uniform distribution and the more particles you have, the more it is. And this incredible uniformity and sphericity is entirely due to Newton's potential theorem. It's unique to three dimensions. And so basically for, if you imagine little bugs inside that thing, the separations between the particles are your rulers. So, this is, the Newtonian theory is defining its own rulers and its own clocks to measure what it's doing. It all comes out of, out of the Newton's second law, the law of gravity and eliminating, eliminating all contamination by absolute elements.

### 1h 15m

And these, these things are, so this was, things like the one on the left, the spherical thing, that's been known for at least 25 years or so, and had been suspected long before. But there's, it's a very nice numerical paper from 2002 by Batty, Gibbons and Sutcliffe. And, so it's never perfectly uniform. Now there's a, now the next thing is, you've got these total collision solutions which you can time reverse, and then they become big bangs, but they're also parabolic escape. And in both cases, they must start with, at one of these special points.

### 1h 16m

Is that, Hyperbolic escape? You can have hyperbolic escape, but it won't be if the energy and angular momentum are zero. Then, then it's not, then they all stay together. They get infinitely, they spread out, but it's not hyperbolic escape. The shape goes on changing forever. But can't you, can't these particles exchange energy and angular momentum in their, because of the gravitational interactions? And then one gets thrown off hyperbolic? So it's like, you've got the stars in the galaxy, they're just zooming out because they were in tight configurations and three bodies. Yes, but, we're getting into, oh, forgot about it, forget about it. I think, yeah, all right. So, but now this is what is, I think, very interesting, because the paper in 2009, 2009 which is given here what they showed

### 1h 17m

is from any they expressed it entirely in Newtonian terms from any configuration of the system for any number of particles there's always a parabolic escape solution to the thing that I call alpha, the absolute minimum of the complexity and it has other splendid properties it minimises the action over any finite length of the solution and there's no collisions in it. Now you could time reverse that and it would look like well the shapes would be I think just the same as if it was a total collision time reversed so if the energy and the angular momentum are both zero and you come and it's either a time reverse total collision or a parabolic escape

### 1h 18m

and I'm only giving you the shapes can you tell in which direction the Newtonian size, the root mean square length is increasing because if you can't it means that that scale has no meaning at all. Now I've discussed this with this friend of mine who's a very highly regarded mathematician at the observatory in Paris and he said, I can't see anything wrong with your argument Julian and I suspect you're right. So I'm putting this forward but if this case is case it says that Newtonian gravity uncontaminated by its absolutes is not only time reversal symmetric but scale reversal symmetric. So that's a new symmetry if that's right that's a new symmetry of Newton's equations. And also the well also Let me mention about the etymology of perfection, which Leibniz pointed out.

### 1h 19m

It's complete. It means perfetuary to complete. So what that means is that it's a complete set of solutions that go from the most uniform shape. If you're just given the shapes, you go from the most uniform shape to any other shape imaginable. And in principle, it would mean that if you just imagined approximated R bodies by point particles, there is a Newtonian solution from the absolute minimum of those point particles to where we are now. It's as productive, as fecund as that, the thing there. So there's a caveat about that. This property may hold for other central configurations and not necessarily for alpha, but it's been proven to... It's been proven to be the case for alpha. So that's what I'm saying. So that's just what I'm really saying. So a total collision, the angular momentum must be zero and the energy is free. In parabolic escape, the energy is zero and the angular momentum is free.

### 1h 20m

But if both of those conditions are satisfied, are those solutions indistinguishable as a succession of shapes? If so, all Newtonian absolutes are meaningless for internal absolutes. And moreover... So unadulterated Newtonian gravity is both time and scale reversal symmetric. And the other thing is there's increasing numerical evidence we're finding that in these circumstances with both energy and angular momentum zero and going from close to alpha, you create more structures. Each individual... There's lots more solutions with interesting properties. There's vastly more interest. There's a lot of interest being created under these circumstances. So my feeling is that Newton inadvertently by... And there's historical reasons why I introduced absolute space and time

### 1h 21m

and with it absolute scale. He put the most incredibly creative system in a box and prevented it from showing all its great creativity. The thing there, I think it's quite remarkable. So let me show you again. Let me show you again what it is like with the next slide. So Newton... Oh, yes. So what did Newton say of the solar system with all the planets going around and so all in the same direction and all the satellites at that stage known to be going in the same direction. It is not to be conceived that mere mechanical causes could give rise to so many regular motions. This most beautiful system of the sun, planets and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being. Now, Newton says explicitly that God started the solar system in a system like that. And then because the planets would perturb each other every now and then he would have to intervene and put them right back in the right order. Fairly soon, people like Laplace and others, I think,

### 1h 22m

had shown that it didn't disrupt nearly so easily as Newton had thought. But it still might. But no, Newton's theory creates all possible shapes out of maximal uniformity. It's far more creative and wonderful than Newton realized. Now, look at this structure. Now, this is creation of structure. So on the left, now in two dimensions, Newton's potential theorem doesn't hold. So on the left is very close to minimum complexity, but you'll see that the separations increase as you go to the rim of the disk. And that was not unexpected. Now, through my... great interest in Newtonian gravity, Manuel... Alain Albuy in Paris, the mathematician, put this Spanish student, Manuel Esquerda, onto finding some central configurations.

### 1h 23m

And just by chance he did something which nobody had done before. Most physicists are always looking for the absolute minimum of something. They're not looking for something that's a bit away from it. So they'd had programs which explicitly stopped them finding local minimums. And they found the minimum and saddles above the absolute minimum. But by chance, this chap had programs that actually found central configurations about only one or two percent above the absolute minimum. And he found these incredible structures, like that. Absolutely amazing structure. And Alain sent me an email. He's finding lines, he meant he's finding filaments. But this was a big surprise to... the top end-body specialists in the world. And people are still wondering about quite how these structures form. So I think that's quite interesting. And also, again, I was delighted when I finally got around

### 1h 24m

to looking up the etymology of creation. It's not from creation out of nothing. It's from the Indo-Germanic word ker, to grow. So this on the left is like a sort of well-tilled soil. And on the right, it's plants growing out of it and eventually... becoming oak trees and things like that. Simon, you have a question? I'm curious, I mean, in the pure M-body case, right, there's no pressure, you know, particles to get arbitrarily close, things like that. I'm just wondering, do these results stick around approximately if you allow... yeah, if you allow for non-gravitational forces? Well, this is very early stages. We're thinking of adding electrostatic forces and seeing what's happening. By the way, I mean, I've already mentioned, you know, I mean, I've already mentioned, you know, I've already mentioned, you know, I've already mentioned that both Tim and I are seriously exploring whether quantum mechanics needs a wave function or a Planck's constant. If it's scale invariant, I don't think there can be a Planck's constant in it because it's dimensionful.

### 1h 25m

So Planck's constant must be emergent. And Tim was the first person to point out that there's a really wonderful generalisation of both. And I think that's where Boltzmann's idea about the Boltzmann formula for entropy. So Boltzmann in 1877 said, molecules in a box, there are vastly more uniform distributions than non-uniform distributions. And that eventually transferred, he didn't write it down when somebody else did, that the entropy S equals K log W. That's where the entropy, the expression for entropy comes from Boltzmann's idea. But now... So my idea back that you'll find in the Janus point is that the complexity should be an internal time. It foliates shape space. So each foliation isocomplexity surface could be called, well, it could be called the age of the universe.

### 1h 26m

You take away the absolute minimum and then the difference between them is the age of the universe. And then interestingly, that difference, you could also say, is the amount of scale invariant potential energy that had been used to create that. So that's a pretty interesting way. But then you say, if I insist on time advancing and time is complexity, how can that happen? Well, the easiest way is just to put a few of the particles in the shape on the left closer to each other, that will increase the complexity. But it violates the cosmological principle. Then you remember Boltzmann's idea and you realize that there's vastly more ways to increase the complexity by changing all the separations a little bit. And actually, before Manuel discovered his amazing one there, I had predicted that all the smallest separations would be the same. And they are.

### 1h 27m

They are on the left, except for this two-dimensional distortion. But in three dimensions, they're all the same. And they are. Now, I was thinking that this was a bit like, thinking in terms of quantum mechanics, I was thinking that this was a bit like, thinking in terms of quantum mechanics, thinking in terms of quantum mechanics, thinking in terms of quantum mechanics, that this was a bit like the Bohr condition which stops the electron falling into the proton. which stops the electron falling into the proton. But Tim said, no, much better is to say that this is mimicking the Pauli exclusion principle. You're just getting the effect of the Pauli exclusion principle. You're mimicking it. So I think that's thought-provoking. So the next thing is, and Tim pointed this out, So the next thing is, and Tim pointed this out, is that the Newtonian configuration space is unbounded, is that the Newtonian configuration space is unbounded, and the root mean square length can go to infinity. But when you're quotient by dilatations

### 1h 28m

to get to shape space, you've got a compact space. And on that compact space, there's a uniquely defined metric, what I call the natural metric or the best match metric. And that means you've got a probability measure on shape space. And this is this nice problem which Lewis Carroll, Charles Dodson here in Oxford claimed he knew the answer to. Given three points in arbitrary positions in an infinite plane, what is the probability that they form an obtuse triangle? He claimed to have the answer, but it was soon found that it was wrong. You have to specify more conditions. So our conditions is that it's, measure that's defined unique comes uniquely this measure on shape space is uniquely defined uniquely singled out and in fact actually I then came to light that a collaborator of mine Edward Anderson had actually solved and there's a lot of whole there's quite a long history

### 1h 29m

on Dodgson's problem and that they give conflicting different results because they make different assumptions and most of them I think quite a lot of them settle around is it two thirds or something like this but anyway Edward Anderson the collaborator of mine actually about a decade ago published the answer within shape dynamics it's three quarters 75% the probability of an obtuse triangle it's unambiguous in this thing there and any you can within certain limits you specify certain limits on what the shape is like say that the most acute angle in the triangle say but this can be applied to any shape the most acute angle in the triangle lies in a certain range what's the probability of finding a triangle like that unique answer in shape space so I had set out to find what I thought would be Newtonian quantum gravity which was a time dependent Schrodinger

### 1h 30m

equation on shape space and our conclusion is you didn't need the wave function or the equation because there's a pre-existing born density on shape space now whether this can really do all of the incredible things that happen with quantum mechanics but it's thought provoking and what is the implication of the fact that there's a there are probabilities there's a probability density on possible shapes it's there so I'm wondering now did Sundman back in 1907 stumble on the principle of creation you say you start with a minimal complexity and then you require the complexity to grow and then structure will form so I'm getting very near the end now oh by the way this is interesting so one of the questions is how much of shape space is occupied by interesting shapes now this is one which is not a central configuration Emand in California

### 1h 31m

found this one and he's dedicated to me he calls it the broken heart somehow or other his program stopped before it got to a proper central configuration and he tests whether he's really found it because he then thinks if he thinks he's got it he then lets them fall under gravity and if they fall together that's fine but this thing when he did it with this he made the most appalling spaghetti mess and so forth but what a shape and there's and so this for this is for a hundred particles so there's basically one hundred factorial particles that are shapes that are central configurations and then there's a huge area all around them because they're at critical points so the whole lot of the those shapes are surrounded by ones in shape space which are of similar structure so there's one hell of a lot of damn interesting shapes in the platonic realm of possible shapes

### 1h 32m

and I think I'm really very close oh this is just to show you how this is again the etymology of creation is to grow this is typical early shapes of one hundred particle in two dimensions so top left are these particles attracting each other gravitationally yeah these are subject to Newtonian gravity basically and what's this I'm looking at a two dimensional space on which they're this is two dimensional Newtonian gravity with a one upon r potential so this doesn't look like anything that would be familiar because they should be they should be Doppler pairs oh this is very very early in the proceedings this is very very early in the proceedings well first of all this is not the result of a numerical simulation these are actually central configurations with increasing complexity and increasing age as I defined them

### 1h 33m

and so all I'm saying is that as the Newtonian solution evolves from alpha which looks like top left it will typically pass through shapes that are more or less like what I'm showing you there and you see how the complexity grows how the structures get ever more intricate and one or two are really quite remarkable look at the this one here I think is look at those two arcs there in this nearly perfect circle I mean this is I mean Simon there's something pretty marvelous about the most basic mathematics you can have in Euclidean geometry that somehow or other it's creating these things no there's no by the way the initial condition is not under your control it is absolutely the theory predicts doesn't by the way these central configurations they go out along the eigen the great bulk of them go out they all go out

### 1h 34m

along eigenvectors and the great bulk of them go out along the one that's got the greatest eigenvalue and initially there's a central configuration they hug that direction so tightly that you cannot distinguish them but then when they get a bit further away from the central configuration they splay out in all directions and if in the conditions of that theorem I told you they will go to every single conceivable shape that you can imagine they will all go out there to that and they will just pass through that and in fact it inverts causality because you need a finite amount of the solution before you can begin to say what the solution is so it's not the case of the past with normal Cauchy data determining the present the present tells you what the past could be like what fraction of what you just said is responsible for the apparent anti-correlation between these points

### 1h 35m

anti-correlation for example in the top left they are absolutely spread out as much as possible they're not pairing at all they're not those points are not random on that disc they've been defined to be away from each other anti-correlated the function of that distribution that is what Newtonian that is typically what Newtonian theory in two dimensions but it will do the same sort of thing in three dimensions we can be sure of that that Newtonian theory just says that is what will happen if I don't allow any absolutes in my theory I just get rid of every contamination and then you just get these remarkable structures and later on in the evolution Kepler pairs will form and you'll be able to measure expansion rates and things like that and it will agree with

### 1h 36m

ephemeris time those are the conditions and also that it comes from a central configuration and preferably from the one that's the absolute minimum of the complexity which is distinguished I mean by the principle of sufficient reason it could come out of other ones in fact these are all central configurations they could all be the initial thing but I mean Newtonian theory says there must be an initial shape of the universe and it tells you what the initial shape will be like and it will tell you the generic way the characteristic way in which the shape will change that's all in Newton's theory if I lay down random points that obey E equals zero L equals zero well you've got to give them velocities to do that right okay if I lay down those points and I run that simulation long enough

### 1h 37m

in one of the two directions I'll hit a minimum of C a minimum of C of the complexity you will you'll almost certainly hit in one way or another you will pass through a Janus point because you can't hit the it would require such fine tuning you couldn't possibly hit the central configuration and actually do that you will pass through the Janus point and you will see the distribution of the particles getting more uniform and then it will spread out more I thought that C was conserved beg your pardon I thought that the shape complexity was conserved in a Janus point it does in a big bang it starts minimal and then increases from then on with fluctuations but if there's many particles the fluctuations don't really show up so when is it conserved? so in general it's not conserved no it's not conserved

### 1h 38m

C is not a constant no C is absolutely not a constant it grows that's the the eternal creativity of the universe in my view so it's supposed to be finite it grows within bounds it grows within bounds right? it kind of oscillates it will fluctuate but if there's if there's sufficiently many particles after a while the fluctuations will become relatively small before that there's the balance within which the shape complexity goes up well there can be very sharp peaks I mean Hitler is finding sharp peaks early on but then the question is once the system has formed has formed well formed isolated subsystems then the fluctuations it's the fluctuations in the mean harmonic length in Newtonian terms that do the damage

### 1h 39m

cause these peaks but that settles down after a while but even before that it's growing within bounds right? it's growing within bounds yes yes but by the way that's closely parallel with what entropy does it grows with fluctuations within bounds where's the heat depth of the universe? no heat depth now if there's a finite number of particles in the end there's a ballet which will get ever more perfectly defined but it's limit cycles so that essentially with a finite number of particles after a while nothing particularly new happens there's most of the systems will break up into kepler pairs which will go off and they will be ever better synchronised and then there will be singletons and kepler pairs now we're beginning to explore what happens can we extend these ideas to infinitely many particles

### 1h 40m

again I'm doing this under influence from and there I there I really think there could be an infinitely creative universe that would go on forever increasing as you go allow ever more particles there's ever more combinatorial possibilities so but for finite dimensional c cannot grow to infinity sorry for finitely many particles oh the complexity always goes to infinity ah it goes to infinity oh yes the complexity is bound to go to infinity so if you replace complexity like if you replace entropy for complexity that's your heat depth right well I was going to ask another question ok sorry sorry no no no what it seems to me is that the usual arrow of time is to say time flows in the direction in which entropy increases yes that's the standard story since

### 1h 41m

the latest Boltzmann if not before but what I'm getting from your talk is that you're saying no the arrow of time follows the direction of which this c constant that you have defined the same complexity increases yup right yes so then like this question where is the heat depth of the universe is like your heat depth is like this amount of like singletons and well nothing particularly new happens yes that would be the case where is dynamic friction in this there is none why is there no dynamic friction? the Newtonian theory deals with point particles it's a very they have different masses the largest mass should produce dynamic friction because as it moves through the little ones will fall in its well I mean until one has got until one has got I mean they basically

### 1h 42m

I mean by the way you don't see I don't think you see this in the actual universe dynamic friction look at any cluster of galaxies you'll see the most massive ones and then how did they get there they got there by oh by the way actually what I should have said certainly in Newtonian theory in the Newtonian theory you can get large clusters of particles forming so they and they will to some extent they will at least virulize at the centre so you can in some senses associate a temperature with them which will be different for two and then they will collide and then when those two collide there will be a growth of entropy but I don't see any clusters of galaxies that we have in the real universe but by that theorem I told you you can create any galaxies you like that at least approximate galaxies in appearance I don't see anything that looks like a cluster of galaxies in any of the pictures but we haven't done those calculations

### 1h 43m

but just look through the Hubble Pace telescope and you see galaxies and these these very good approximations to them at the level of I mean let's go back to the atomistic theory the atomistic theory was that all that we see is really indivisible atoms now interestingly they said they had shape and size but they were indivisible now what we're doing is actually having pure point particles but still with pure point particles pure points on a piece of white paper a good cartoonist can do an image of Donald Trump quite easily so you can just as easily do things that look like spiral galaxies and Newton's theory will generate them out of alpha that's a mathematical theorem so the idea is that you can have central configuration such that one you let it evolve under Newton gravity

### 1h 44m

instead of just Kepler pairs you can have large clusters of Kepler pairs that form each other and you can have something that resembles more you can certainly you can go to any shape you want that's this remarkable theorem you can go from the most uniform shape which is not absolutely uniform to any shape you want any shape you want so the Russian has this theory and Donald Lyndon Bell has a nice paper on it the gravitational catastrophe or the heat whatever it is the gravothermal catastrophe and basically but by the way the Russian put that system in a box and so did Donald Lyndon Bell I mean I beg your pardon totally unreal and this is a hawking box

### 1h 45m

too as far as I know come on tell that one to the marines there's a physical box out there that's stopping these things they fly out to infinity or they go on forever they go flying out there but what's left I mean the conjecture is what's left is a very tightly bound Kepler pair in many cases that's what will be left but in the universe the dynamic friction which produces clusters of galaxies does not depend on any box no no but I'm glad about that and I'm saying Newton can approximate that I suspect rather well well then I don't see it anywhere if there were three really heavy masses or just one well let's I mean they don't stick they don't stick they pass past each other you know arbitrarily close as long as there's no pressure so if you just have one particle like if you put three heavy masses they'd sink to the center dump all the kinetic energy into multiple

### 1h 46m

but then any pair would get harder and harder and harder and then it would be essentially a bigger mass and then it would run into another one and then it would get harder and harder you have two hard pairs coming together right you don't get a a quartet that's harder no you get a triple and one yeah okay you get a triple no no I don't think so you get a triple and you get another guy in you don't get a quartet I think that's the by the way there is there is this famous result which is expressed within absolute time where with five particles you can get four particles you can get all the particles going off to infinity in finite Newton time that's C-A-Z-I X-R-C-A A but that's still a perfectly well defined curve in shape space

### 1h 47m

it's there's no problem with it from the point of view of shape dynamics yeah but with point particles there is no friction but there is effective friction I mean I gave the example of two clusters that have more or less virulized at least in their centers and you can approximately give a ratio of temperatures with them and then if they collide then there will be sort of friction effects yes that can happen but Newton can do that well not here that's not a result of friction because of this result of that thing you can get those things that will form and they could pass through each other I just want to go on to the very last thing I think so I just want to say my conjecture is that you should replace the idea of laws of nature by a law of the universe from which

### 1h 48m

local laws of nature emerge in through the evolution of the universe and so I mean I would say the law of the universe is that it's a constrained Hamiltonian system and I already showed you that very significant book of Dirac lectures on quantum mechanics which is a much cited book by people working in gauge theory and then the simplest examples are n-body machin solutions with both those things zero and then subsystems form with all possible values provided the totals are zero so the law of the universe is all solutions begin maximally uniform at alpha for that I require the principle of sufficient reason to justify that but then there are emergent laws of nature which are governed by the principle of least action and allow all possible conserved quantities and this is true for arbitrary large n and then

### 1h 49m

I think but this is still very tentative that these ideas at least to some extent can it be extended to infinitely many particles and I think the very last slide is this one is cosmological inflation necessary so this is I took the trouble to check up Harrison of the Harrison-Zeldovich fluctuations so I mean the story I mean the great thing was Harrison and Zeldovich proposed exactly scale invariant fluctuations at some stage Harrison says well let me read you of the various let's see what Harrison says the various problems relating to galaxy formation the most perplexing is the nature and origin of the initial conditions the initial homogeneities which eventually develop into galaxies cannot arise spontaneously in an expanding universe and must therefore already exist in primitive form when the universe

### 1h 50m

begins to expand it is proposed that the initial homogeneities are fluctuations at the threshold of classical cosmology he's implying there that the quantum stage becomes classical and so the current paradigm requires this exponential inflation driven expansion and quantum fluctuations of the inflaton and the start and end of inflation are increasingly seen as problematic now although the fluctuations that are generated are terrifically successful but about ten years ago I was at a workshop in Durham where Peebles was so Peebles this famous thing which shows all the where the powers are in the microwave background Peebles essentially got that several years before inflation arrived on the scene and he developed the idea of Joe Silk I forget what silks were so Silk was

### 1h 51m

the first and Peebles the next and that's essentially what Peebles got the Nobel Prize for a few years ago and I asked Peebles was what would he say in terms of what inflation had brought into the thing and he thought quite a long time and he said that the slope is not quite one but slightly less than one but that was only a gut feeling I think of the main Russian chap I can't remember his name who was pushing inflation early on so I think that's quite interesting so at least Newtonian big bangs give the desiderata qualitatively because those fluctuations the minimum thing if I go back to the previous questions in that paper that I cited by Batty Gibbons and Hawking they describe that distribution as being glassy

### 1h 52m

and there's a nice paper by the Irishman Michael anyway it's an Irishman and anyway he says that normally things are represented in Fourier space as a straight line but if you want to see what the inner majorities look like in real space they look like a glassy liquid and so that's not a bad approximation on the left to a glassy liquid I can guarantee you that the n neither of those, the n were close to 1 well I mean this is a conjecture and if you can do that then I'll be glad sorry the power spectrum is not linear all the way

### 1h 53m

there's a turnover isn't there well I mean I'm not an expert in this I'm just throwing it out as an extreme possibility as a as a most optimistic possibility but I mean a lot of more work needs I think that really brings it to the end but thank you very much for all the questions and critique at the least I hope to have persuaded you that Newtonian theory is a great deal more interesting than people realize thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one bye bye you
