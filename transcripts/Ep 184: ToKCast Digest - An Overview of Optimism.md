## Transcript

### 0m

Welcome to TopCast, where I'm speaking to you in the shadow of what was one of the greatest interviews, if not the greatest interview so far, of David Deutsch, by Naval Ravikant on The Tim Ferriss Show. Now, this is unusual for The Tim Ferriss Show. Normally, Tim would be doing the interviewing. He did play a supporting role, as he said. I found it one of the most insightful overviews of David's work, and in fact, we had a lot of gems in there that David hadn't spoken about much anywhere else, from what I can recollect anyway. Well worth going to The Tim Ferriss Show, if you're not aware that David appeared on there, and getting hold of that episode, because we're worth listening to more than once. You can easily find Tim Ferriss' webpage, of course, using Google, and there, not only is there a link to the show for downloadability, on your podcast platforms, but there is a comprehensive set of show notes. So, if you're a fan of the work of David Deutsch, this is a wonderful one-stop place to get links to a whole bunch of related things.

### 1m

And yes, TopCast appears among them. What I loved about this interview that Naval and Tim did with David was, well, at certain points, Naval was unpacking David's worldview, and I'm going to get to some of that today, but also explaining, how David had made these fundamental contributions to each and every strand of the fabric of reality. So, not only does the beginning of infinity, and the fabric of reality, explain our deepest theories, namely, epistemology, and computation, and quantum theory, and the theory of evolution, but Naval was able to explain how David Deutsch himself had made seminal contributions to each of these areas, and that's rarely been done in an interview before. So, I urge you to listen out for that, in particular. Another highlight for me was David's wry sense of humor, which is easily able to escape people if they're not paying attention. Around about 53 minutes in, he's talking about the distinction that he makes between artificial general intelligence and artificial intelligence.

### 2m

And he said, well, he said, quote, An AI, a narrow artificial intelligence, an AI can only do the narrow thing that it's supposed to do. Like a better chatbot is one that replies, replies in good English, replies to the question you ask, can look things up for you, doesn't say anything politically incorrect. And I thought that was a wonderful dig at the way in which some of this current crop of chatbots has been, let's say, massaged in such a way to ensure that it doesn't say anything too offensive to contemporary ears, I suppose. What is so attractive for me when, even I, who've been explaining this, for years now, listen to someone else talk about the worldview is just the logic to the whole thing. There's just such a logic to the worldview once you see it, so to speak.

### 3m

And this can sometimes be difficult for people, especially if they only understand one aspect of it or two aspects of it. You kind of need to see the whole to understand how it coheres together. And once you do, you're on the roller coaster. By which I mean, you're on the tracks. And you're heading down that hill irrevocably. There's no going back. You are on the ride. And there's no looking behind you to try and go back from where you came because some other force is pulling you forward. In the case of the roller coaster, it's gravity. In the case of David Deutsch's worldview, it's reason. It's reason. You simply see the world via this perspective that makes sense. And it's a perspective that you notice allows you to see the world differently. And when you're first going, through the transition, you can sometimes compare both perspectives, the perspective you held and are escaping from and the new perspective that you now adhere to. Then as time goes on, like with me, I sometimes find myself in a position where I find it difficult to appreciate what it is I used to think about these particular things.

### 4m

What I used to think about believing in the science, for example. And now recognizing that although science is the only way that we can generate reliable knowledge about reality, valid knowledge about reality, actual knowledge about reality, good explanations about reality, that nonetheless, it can all be completely false. Or if not false in all respects, false in the final analysis. That can be jarring to people. And it can sound like a form of relativism, but it's not. It's just humble fallibilism. Based upon this notion that what we are are people doing computations of a kind. An explanation is a kind of computation. No computer is perfect. They're error prone. And so too will be our explanations. A therefore. And there's a lot of therefore going on. When you take on this worldview, you're looking at stuff differently. You're observing everything in a slightly different way.

### 5m

Not just with your eyes. And you're not just observing physical things, of course. You're looking at science itself differently. You're looking at mathematics differently. All of knowledge differently. You're looking at people differently. You're looking at them as different. You're looking at them as genuine equals in a scientific sense. Not merely some sort of spiritual sense. Although it has that sense to some people sometimes. You look at the old way. The other ways that people have of looking at the world in terms of justifying their beliefs. In terms of relying upon the authority of science and scientists. And you look at those things and the finiteness of the capacity of humans to change the world. Or the finiteness of the resources. Or the fact that we aren't super beings and super intelligences, but those super intelligences are coming. All of those other ways of looking at the world, you look at those as finite. As an end in some way.

### 6m

As very limiting. As debasing of people. Debasing of knowledge. A poverty of opportunity. As constraining, restrictive, and coercive. But with David Deutsch's worldview, you have tools at your disposal. Not merely a worldview. But these tools that allow you to combat bad thinking. But at the same time, you never think of yourself or your side, the other people who agree with you, as any better. Or any less error prone. Because you know as part of this worldview that all of us are fallible and flawed all the time. But we can improve. We can always make progress. Always. Off into an infinite future. So your mind expands to take into account these infinite possibilities. These genuinely infinite possibilities, physically, abstractly, as a matter of time off into the infinite future for humanity and civilization, your mind expands to take on physical reality as far larger than anything that you ever thought it could have been.

### 7m

The scope and scale of opportunity that you see before you and before humanity is utterly unrivaled in any other picture of the universe. Now, David Deutsch is extremely modest. In the sense that he thinks that his contribution is footnotes to Popper, and he says it again in this interview. Now, of course, I notice myself when I read through the work of Popper, you can see echoes of Popper in David Deutsch. Absolutely, the imprint is there. But, okay, I can take that on board. But, as a person who has been doing this for a while and studying both of them for quite some time, I must say that Popper doesn't really invoke the cosmic significance. He doesn't invoke the cosmic significance of physics, for example, in the same way that Deutsch does. And really lays it out explicitly for you. David presents a grand vision of science, and in particular the physical sciences, but not only, of course, the biological sciences as well, as having this deeply fundamental role in the universe, in being able to shape the universe, and through us.

### 8m

And that's not something you quite get from Popper. And David, of course, presents something that I think that Popper has. That Popper really just goes by Popper's philosophy altogether. And it's no fault of his. Popper was making huge leaps and advances in the philosophy of science, and epistemology broadly, and the philosophy of history, and so on and so forth. Political philosophy. So this is no complaint about Popper. What I'm saying is that when David says he's doing footnotes to Popper, I think it's far grander than that. And in particular, in particular, and what Naval and I have focused on, is this kind of optimism. That David Deutsch presents us with. It is not, as some people have misconceived recently, I've noticed. It is not. Optimism, in David Deutsch's sense, is not about thinking that everything's going to be rosy, or that everything is rosy, or should be looked at through rose-colored glasses.

### 9m

It has nothing to do with that. In fact, it's almost the opposite of that. It says there's going to be problems. That sounds bad. But the optimistic part is they can always be solved by people. Unless there is a law of physics standing in the way. And even when there is a law of physics standing in the way, usually that problem that you think is a problem is not in fact a problem. The laws of physics don't present us with problems. They just tell us what is possible and impossible. Again, another part of David Deutsch's deep philosophical understanding of the way in which knowledge grows through his most recent advance. The philosophical and physical theory that is constructor theory. So if you're new to all this, or even if you're not, if you're an old fan and you've been watching since the beginning, I want to go back through. Some of the archives, so to speak, and to point out what TopCast is about and what this philosophical worldview entails. Because TopCast is kind of obtuse.

### 10m

It is a strange podcast at times. It's not one of these ones where people do interviews with guests. I've had one guest. That's David Deutsch himself. And I'll probably get him back at some point. I might do some more interviews in the future. But TopCast is primarily, or started out primarily as an attempt by me. To simply understand these books that David Deutsch had put out. Because they stood apart. I was a geeky, nerdy kind of kid who used to like to read lots and lots and lots. And I really enjoyed all the books that I could get my hands on. Whether they were fantasy and science fiction, or popular science, or rigorous scientific texts. And although I had read The Fabric of Reality, I read it before podcasts were even a thing. It wasn't until the beginning of Infinity. That I realized. Look, here's a book that is so important. Merely telling people to read it, or buying it as a gift for someone, wasn't enough. This was something that had to be spread to the masses.

### 11m

It needed to be unpacked properly. Even if only for myself. Which is the way in which I first started the podcast, as I say. Reading through passages in the book. And representing them in my own words. And it was that way. That I felt that I began to ground myself, so to speak. In the content of the world view. Of the way in which we approach absolutely everything that a human can approach. And there is some disagreement on that. That, well, does this contain everything? Well, it doesn't contain everything except insofar as I think people should approach the world. And every interaction they have. Whether it's other books and other thinkers. Reading and writing. The business world. The family world. Whatever it happens to be. In a spirit of reason. Because reason is unbounded. But what is this thing, reason? What is this capacity to understand?

### 12m

And it doesn't matter whether the understanding is explicit. You can write it down in words. Or inexplicit. Where you can't. Understanding could be, you understand how to ride a bike. You understand how to catch a ball. Those things might not be able to be easily captured in words. But they are part of reason. A reasoned conception of the world. And at the moment, the best encapsulation of reason that I'm aware of. And believe me, I have tried to search for others. I'll talk about some of those in this episode. This world view presented in the beginning of infinity in the fabric of reality. Is the one that coheres. And as far as possible is able to explain many of the strands of reality. The way in which we would approach an understanding. Of the world. So once I finished going through the beginning of infinity. I realized that really what I was interested in doing here was. Trying to generate more knowledge about knowledge. Trying to explain explanations.

### 13m

And so of course, next on the list was the fabric of reality. But I found I was doing other episodes as well on TopCast. So let me give a rundown of what the episodes are. And perhaps even if you're a long time listener. Some that you may have missed or some that might pique your interest again. Now TopCast. Is available on YouTube. Where at least some of the episodes are intended to be viewed as videos. However, all of them are available as audio on all podcast platforms. Everything's free and everything's ad free as well. I've always done this as a labor of love. It's a community service so to speak. I think these ideas are very important, especially for this moment in history. We need more optimism. We need more. We need more appreciation for the central role that people play in making the world a better place and the fact that we don't need to be down all the time individually and as a civilization we have so much to look forward to the world continues to get better this optimistic view of the world is a strong theme that runs through every episode of the podcast.

### 14m

I would hope if you go to YouTube, you will see me there and. If you click on the tab that says videos, then you can scroll all the way back to the very beginning of where TopCast began. Or you can go to any one of the podcast platforms from Apple through to Podbean through to Spotify and scroll all the way back to episode one. Sometimes the numbering is a bit different on Apple podcasts and compared to other things. If you do go to YouTube and you do scroll all the way to the very beginning of the list of videos that I have. You'll find a bunch of resources. There from back in the days before I was doing podcasting at all, there is a version of TopCast, which I have up there and I don't have all the episodes there numbered TopCast episodes three, four, five, six and seven.

### 15m

And those are from a previous iteration of TopCast where I was explaining things like the nature of mathematics, limitations of mathematics, and there that was a primitive version of TopCast and the way in which I would phrase things now might be subtly different. I might have completely changed. Yeah. I might have completely changed my mind. However, on some other things, like for example, the episode called the problem of induction, which goes for 43 minutes and 37 seconds, I won't have changed my mind. There's some stuff there from when I used to teach physics, for example. So there's a long video about the photoelectric effect, which is one of the seminal experiments that can be conducted within the field of quantum theory to show that light has this quantum property. It comes in discrete packets of energy. And you can, the experiment that I do allows you to calculate Planck's constant from graphing some data. My training, my master's, my science degree was in astronomy and astrophysics. So I've got a presentation there from when I taught astrophysics.

### 16m

And so there's some stuff there about that. And there's some stuff on critical and creative thinking, which I still endorse to this day. Moving through my videos, there's a bunch of stuff there that are short videos about knowledge in general. There's one there about free will. Consciousness, creativity, and choice. Something about subjective knowledge, which is something that Popper actually talked about. Popper's main thing was objective knowledge, but he actually had an essay about subjective knowledge. And I try to explain that as well. What I'm saying here is that not everything that I produce is the beginning of infinity and the fabric of reality. There is other supporting materials, so to speak, emblematic of the fact that not everything is to do directly with. The beginning of infinity is there is a reaction video that I did. It's titled Reason, What Is It? And it's comments on Dave Rubin and Jordan Peterson in conversation with Greg Salmieri and Yaron Brook.

### 17m

Salmieri and Brook are philosophers and popularizers of the philosophy of Ayn Rand. And, well, everyone knows who Jordan Peterson is and Dave Rubin is a journalist. And so they're talking about what reason is. And, of course, I think that's a good thing. And, of course, I think that's a good thing. And, of course, I think that's a good thing. Well, if not completely wrong, I think they make some crucial errors. They're not Popperian. They don't understand things about what conjectural knowledge is, for example. They don't understand things about fallibilism. And so I like to do commentaries on when other intellectuals try and explain reason and rationality. Because even if it's objectivism, even if it's Ayn Rand, who is a relatively recent philosopher, they make the same old mistakes. They make the same old mistakes. If you don't have contact with Popper, then they're not presenting you with the most up-to-date version of our understanding of knowledge and reason and rationality, for that matter. But really, TopCast itself, especially on the podcast platform, it begins with episode one, of course.

### 18m

And episode one is an introduction to the entire series. Because I started putting out the audio podcasts about 15 episodes in or so to the YouTube channel. So I'd created 15 or so episodes of... The series on the beginning of infinity and then decided, well, let me take the audio from each of these and turn it into a regular audio podcast. But before I do that, let me create an episode one, which is an introduction. So on the audio platforms, you get this introduction, which is also available on YouTube as well, just as audio. And so that episode one of TopCast is TopCast, an introduction. Episode two is where I begin the discussion itself. The exposition of the beginning of infinity, chapter one. Reach of explanations. And these initial episodes are... Well, I completely endorse the content of everything that I say there. I don't think that I would change much in terms of my language. The central message is exactly the same.

### 19m

The only thing that I would change if I was to re-record any of this stuff would be perhaps the confidence of the presentation. I'm a little bit halting. I'm not very well-practiced in doing podcasting. I've been relatively well-practiced in... In public speaking. No problem with that. But I didn't know how microphones worked. I'm still not... I'm still not all that good with microphones and audio equipment and that kind of thing. The technical side of things is still my greatest downfall. Nevertheless, I'm better now. I'm more confident now. And I kind of know how to engage a little bit better with things like podcasting, having been interviewed myself. But back then, I didn't know exactly how to do that thing. And also, as I say, I was making these early on purely for myself. Because I thought, if I can explain it out loud, such that other people watching would understand what I say, then that means that I myself understand it. And so we begin with reach of explanations, and then we move through chapter two, chapter three, chapter four.

### 20m

And on YouTube, it's very beginning of infinity heavy, where I just go through absolutely all of the chapters, sometimes a single episode with a single chapter. But then other times, for example, we get to chapter four, and you'll say, see, it is split into two parts. The name of chapter four of the beginning of infinity is creation. There's part one, and there's part two. Because in the beginning of infinity, it's sort of divided in two parts. There's creation in terms of how biological knowledge comes into existence via evolution, by natural selection. And there's also, well, the creation of the entire universe, where David talks about this issue of fine-tuning, which is certainly a hobby horse of mine, one of my deep interests having studied astrophysics and cosmology at university. This was one of my, the most fascinating areas of that subject for me, and so something that I talk about throughout TalkCast at various points. Around about that time of doing that episode, the creation part two, fine-tuning,

### 21m

David Deutsch and Sam Harris had their second interview together, what was then called the Waking Up Podcast, what is now called the Making Sense Podcast. Sam Harris interviewed David Deutsch twice. The second time they spoke, they talked about Sam's book, The Moral Landscape, and what David thought about Sam's book, The Moral Landscape, David's view on morality, which is kind of similar to his view on reason broadly, and what these disciplines that we call, for want of another word, disciplines, science, mathematics, morality, philosophy, how it is that the methods within each, although subtly different, cannot possibly operate by completely different laws of epistemology. In other words, you can only create knowledge in the one way, and you're always fallible. So this concept of having a base foundation that can't be altered is misguided. It's as misguided in morality as it is in science and indeed mathematics.

### 22m

David's not a foundationalist. Now, if that sort of gets your hackles up and you think, well, that sounds ridiculous, well, I would urge you to listen to or watch that particular episode where I break down the breakdown in the conversation between Sam Harris and David Deutsch, and I'll talk to you about that in a bit. So that's the first episode. Well, it wasn't a breakdown. It's just that Sam, even towards the end of the conversation, didn't understand where the disagreement was. And many listeners to that also didn't understand what it was David was disagreeing with. And this is one of the great difficulties sometimes with the worldview. And so as I explain that video, the difficulty is in language precisely because, and Sam Harris appreciates this. He's a brilliant man. He understands. He understood that David was using words like knowledge, belief, foundation in a way that was different to Sam. And so although the words were the same,

### 23m

the languages were different because the intended meaning of the words was different. Is David being unfair by revolutionizing language? No, because he's not. What David is trying to do is to explain what the words actually mean. And often he's cleaving to the common sense man on the street understanding of some of these words, like knowledge, for example. Do you know where your keys are? Yes, I know where my keys are. They're in my pocket. Now, what that doesn't mean is I'm absolutely certain and I have a justified true belief that my keys are in my pocket. You just know. That's your best guess. You've ruled out everything else immediately. You know that they're not on the moon. They're in your pocket. That's the last place you remember having them. Are you justified? Have you felt your keys in your pocket? Perhaps you haven't. It's just that you know that that's where they are. You've got an explanation because why would they be elsewhere? This is what David means when he talks about something like know and knowledge, but what some professional philosophers

### 24m

or some professional podcasters often don't appreciate. And even when he's having a conversation with people, it completely goes over their head. And so when there's a disagreement about something like, what should your moral foundation be? David says an explanation about how there shouldn't be foundations in knowledge and this includes morality and you can only have questions about what you should do next and that requires you to create some knowledge and explanation about what would be best to do next. Having explained that, people will still come back at him and ask, but what is the moral foundation of the theory you're using in order to choose what to do next? And so sometimes the discussion can go in circles. So that's an episode. I think that remains, I think, my most watched episode ever. Certainly on YouTube anyway. Some of the other episodes on the podcast audio platform might have more listens, so to speak. Having spoken to people about the beginning of infinity many, many times over the years,

### 25m

one of the chapters that comes up most for questions people ask me about is chapter five. And chapter five is titled, The Reality of Abstractions. In that, David lays out the case of how not everything can be explained in terms of physical forces and particles. That there are these things we call abstractions that have real physical effects in the world but are themselves not physical. And again, if that's blowing your mind or if that makes you think, ah, spirituality, ah, mysticism, ah, the supernatural, no, it has nothing to do with any of those things. It's not to do with anything supernatural. David spends a vast amount, a vast amount of time using many examples, even in his interview with Naval and with Tim Ferriss, denying that the supernatural is ever a good explanation. And especially in the beginning of infinity, he makes that point over and again. So in the reality of abstractions, he is not appealing to the supernatural.

### 26m

He's appealing to reason. And saying that, things like mathematics are about abstractions. But what are these abstractions? How can these mathematical things that are abstract have effects in the physical world? That's why you should read the reality of abstractions. That's why you should get the book first. Read that chapter. And then if you're struggling, watch my video where I try to explain using other examples what we mean by the reality of abstractions. That's spread over, again, two episodes. Chapter six is the jump to universality. A theme of David Deutsch's work is about universality, about how some systems have this quality we call universality. Chapter six, I won't explain more now. Very fashionable. At the moment. Very timely, I suppose, is chapter seven, all about artificial creativity. So it includes discussions about AGI. AGI versus AI. AGI would be an artificially creative thing. In other words, artificial in the sense that it didn't arise via the means of evolution

### 27m

by natural selection, such as we did. It would have to be coded by us. Artificial creativity. Chapter eight is a mathematical chapter about infinity and about why, and the ways that your intuitions might be challenged by the reality of infinity and what infinity does and can do. Chapter nine is one of my favorites. It's simply titled Optimism. And so it is kind of the keystone chapter, really, where David outlines what I regard as one of his greatest contributions to Popper's philosophy, additions to Popper's philosophy. This is not a footnote. This is a capstone, if anything. The explanation of how people can change, how they can change reality fundamentally. And as David said in his interview with Naval and Tim, astrophysics off into the infinite future will be a story of what choices people make, not merely about the effects of gravity

### 28m

and the temperature of gases. And so I spend three episodes discussing that chapter, the chapter on optimism. Chapter 10 is called A Dream of Socrates. It's the one that is most directly about the powers of epistemology, written as largely a dialogue between Socrates, a god, Hermes, and Plato. Top Cast episode 22, which in the YouTube videos comes after my discussion of chapter 10, A Dream of Socrates, is one of these episodes that comes up now and again, where I move away from the books altogether and I go to a technical paper. In this case, it's a technical paper that David has written, And it's an hour and three minutes of me discussing something called the logic of experimental tests. And this is a heavy paper, but what I regard as the absolute best and the pinnacle of our understanding of the philosophy of science. This is David Deutsch at his best,

### 29m

taking the work of Popper and taking it further, telling us about the role of the crucial experiment. Now, it's not to say that Popper didn't get this at all, but David is applying it to Everettian quantum theory, among other things. So the multiverse, he explains how the multiverse is testable, but also of course, explains in part the central role that explanation plays and how in science, what the purpose of an experiment is. You might think, I know what the purpose of experiments is, but do you? Do you realize, for example, and again, I go to the interview with David, Naval and Tim. You need to have more than one theory to test the theory. There's no point doing an experiment, a crucial test, I should say, on a theory if there are no alternatives. After all, whatever the outcome of the experiment is, has to be, even if it's inconsistent with the theory,

### 30m

cannot tell you that the theory is false. Because if it's inconsistent with the theory, your best explanation is there's something wrong with your experiment. There's something wrong with your experiment. This is sometimes known as the Juhamquine thesis. David goes through that, and I spend an hour and three minutes talking about that. Personally, I find the paper absolutely fascinating. And for students of philosophy, absolutely essential reading. Next, we get to one of the epic parts of TopCast, I suppose. Here, I spend five episodes discussing chapter 11. Chapter 11 is the multiverse. The multiverse, I think, was explained in the fabric of reality very, very well in chapter two called Shadows. But in the beginning of infinity, David introduces new concepts, this notion of fungibility. So I go through an introduction to quantum theory. I explain some of the important

### 31m

experiments that are there in quantum theory, establishing the need for us to invoke this thing called the multiverse, which is not merely parallel universes. So get that out of your mind. That's one of the first misconceptions, that these things are just purely parallel universes, other alternate realities which don't interact. They do. But more importantly, as Naval has pointed out, these are things are needed in order to explain the functionality of the quantum computer when it arrives. So five-part series. There's a playlist for the multiverse. But it's also one of those chapters, I do admit, where if you're not into physics, then you can skip past it. But I think that the entire the entirety of the beginning of infinity should be read. But okay, fair enough. If you're not into physics, then maybe you can skip ahead. Maybe you can skip ahead to chapter 12, which is one of the most fun chapters in the book, just because it's about some absolute silliness that goes on in

### 32m

professional academia. The title of chapter 12 is A Physicist's History of Bad Philosophy. And it really is a history of bad philosophy. And in particular, what the intellectual community has done to us over the last few decades, the poverty of ideas that appears there in certain areas of professional philosophy. And you might think, what do I care about professional philosophy? Who cares? Well, philosophy is effectively upstream of the rest of academia, which is upstream of politics and culture. You better want to take note of what the philosophers are doing in university departments. For whatever reason, they tend to direct the way in which the other academics think. And the other academics tend to direct the way in which, well, anyone who defers to experts think. So the media and politicians, business people, they look to the academics because, hey, they're the experts. But who do the experts look to? The philosophers. Why? Well, it's a long tradition of this. In some sense,

### 33m

they should. This is what ancient Greek culture taught us. This is what some of the best civilizations that exist. Prior to our enlightenment. Indeed, the enlightenment in ourself taught us. We can do this again, but we have to have a criteria for what are the good philosophies and what are the not so good philosophies. That's what chapter 12 is about. Chapter 12 is essential reading. And I would say anyone who picks up the video in infinity, that's one place that you simply cannot miss is chapter 12. Spend time reading it and rereading it and understanding. Because even today, we have bad philosophies. All that stuff, we don't have. We don't have good philosophies. You hear about critical theory, critical gender, queer theory, that stuff, postmodernism, the stuff that animates Jordan Peterson so often. Well, there's just one part of David Deutsch's entire focus. But I find his razor sharp and clearly targeted at where it should be targeted. The

### 34m

relativists, yes, but the linguistic school of philosophy also. And I have a lot to say about that throughout. Chapter 13 is about choices, about rational choice theory. And that goes over two parts about how it is that we make decisions. How it is we make decisions and whether or not we should weigh our options based upon, well, the preponderance of evidence, for example. This is misconceived. How could that be misconceived? Well, because people create new options. And so that's what choices is about. And then we get to, well, what are the good philosophies? And then we get to, well, one of the most controversial chapters of all in the beginning of infinity, which is chapter 14. Why are flowers beautiful? Where David makes the case for objective beauty. He's not denying their subjective beauty, that everyone has their own taste. But he's making the case for something more than just that. More than just, well, you can't say what song is actually better. Some people

prefer Britney Spears and some people prefer Justin Bieber. And there's nothing you can say about which one is actually better. Okay, fine. We all understand that. But is there an objective beauty out there in the world worth striving for? Is there a way in which to rank order aesthetic things? Well, a case is made in chapter 14 that there are. Then on YouTube, I have an episode called Top Cast, The Borders of Ideas. And this is a discussion about some of the work of Douglas Murray, where I'm talking about some of his views that broadly I support. But here, I'm talking about the focus on aspects of the immigration debate at times. Whether we should certain people out. And my argument is, it's not about keeping certain people out. It's about keeping sometimes ourselves protected from very bad ideas. And it's an important distinction to make. And I make that case there. Recently, I've begun on Top Cast to make shorts, as they're called. Abbreviated versions of some of my episodes. But before this was a thing on the

### 36m

YouTubes, I was doing introductions. So there's an introduction to Popper and Deutsch that stretches four episodes. There's an introduction to the introductions. And so those are worth watching if you just want a short snippet, a short introduction to these things. So I've got Deutsch Digests and Deutsch Discoveries. That's part two. I've got Popper Primer and then Popper Pieces. That's part two. And so those are worth watching for people that just want something much shorter than my usual half an hour, 45 minute or one hour episodes. Okay. So around there, on YouTube anyway, we have a discussion also of chapter 15. This is the evolution of culture that spreads over three parts. It's very important because it contains David's exposition of some absolutely new insights into meme theory. And David explains the differences in culture

### 37m

between what are known as static societies and dynamic societies. This is an improvement upon Popper. Again, I don't think a footnote. I think this is an important improvement on open and closed societies, which is what Popper talks about. In terms of memes, anti-rational and rational memes. Anti-rational memes, the things that prevent people from criticizing. That these ideas that prevent people from actually being able to improve their understanding of the world and improve their situation and their circumstance. And so this is a true discovery by David Deutsch, a true advance. And what Naval says, was an advance beyond evolution by natural selection, which I think is quite right that David Deutsch has made. So again, David Deutsch has made contributions to epistemology, to computation, to physics, and to meme theory. That sort of straddles both biological evolution

### 38m

and also epistemology. Now, if you're looking at TopCast, the audio only podcast, rather than the YouTube version, you're going to see that TopCast is a podcast that is based on the TopCast feed. You'll find that there are some slightly different episodes peppered in amongst the TopCast feed. For example, within the multiverse series, the multiverse series includes, for example, episode 24 of TopCast is part two of the multiverse. Episode 25 is part three. But then we get to episode 26 and it's something different altogether. It's called Problems, Knowledge and Wealth. And then episode 27 is Christian Atheists. And these things are not to do with, centrally, the beginning of infinity. They're something, slightly different. And then we get back into, if you're on the audio only version, episode 28 is back to being the multiverse. And so this is what I mean about sometimes we have these unusual episodes that appear in the audio feed. And sometimes some of the video ones, for example, those short snippets, the introductions to Popper and Deutsch, don't appear in the audio

### 39m

version. They're only on YouTube. Returning to YouTube, though, once we've dealt with chapter 15, the evolution of culture, then David seamlessly moves into, a very closely related chapter, which is the evolution of creativity. And so that is about, well, creativity arising both in biological evolution and in people as well. And what it was used for in people for rather a long time. I mentioned anti-rational memes earlier. And so that brings in this concept of ways in which ideas can actually misfire and cause us as human beings, who have the creative ability to improve, to sometimes not improve. Because we've used our creativity to actually hamper our creativity. It's creativity directed at reducing creativity, which is something, unfortunately, that can happen. And at its very worst, it can cause an entire society to cease being creative and striving for improvements. And this is where we

### 40m

get this notion of stasis. And around about this time, as I do the evolution of creativity, chapter 16, across three parts. So part zero. When I say part zero, there's a number of episodes where I refer to the chapters as part zero. Part zero is where I do absolutely no reading from the chapter, but rather it's an introduction to the chapter. It's some pre-reading, if you like, often of other sources, or it could be just me laying the foundations of what I might have learned at, let's say, university about those things. Because some of my background is in philosophy and physics, for example. And so I might be telling you what the mainstream, my ideas are that are taught in academia about these things. But in this series here of the evolution of creativity, you'll notice on YouTube that there's a bunch of episodes here where I've really gone for something different. And so, for example, we have an episode just titled Free Will Exists, an argument for the busy. It's 26 minutes of me defending the thesis of

### 41m

free will, borrowing heavily from David Deutsch's copper atom argument, which will come again later. There's also a fun episode there for those who are interested in this question of life elsewhere in the universe. And that's simply called Are We Alone? And I try and provide all the background that I'm aware of from my time studying actual astrobiology. Yes, it's a subject. It's a subject without subject matter, as one of the lecturers used to be fond of saying. We haven't discovered alien life yet. We haven't discovered life beyond the earth at all yet. So having a subject, astrobiology, seems a bit strange, but it's about the serious science of it is about the constraints that can be placed upon how evolution by natural selection might work out there in the universe and how biological organisms, what they would need minimally in order to thrive somewhere beyond the earth. What are the conditions that might be needed? And then beyond that,

### 42m

what are the conditions that would be required for intelligent life to arise somewhere else? Are those conditions different? What are the arguments for and, hence, I don't come down on a particular side, but I do try to provide arguments that you may not have ever heard elsewhere. And people say things like, and this is a hobby horse of mine, that the number of planets orbiting the number of stars in the number of galaxies out there in the cosmos is astronomical. Astronomical. This is where the word astronomical really gains its currency. What I try to explain is that there are numbers much larger than astronomical ones. Biological ones. The argument there is in Are We Alone? And I draw heavily on the work of, for example, a lecturer of mine, Charlie Lineweaver. And so I think that's a fun listen. After that are two more unusual episodes. One is called Cosmological Economics, the argument for infinite growth. One of these contentious issues about this idea of infinite

### 43m

optimism. The idea that we can have unbounded knowledge creation, therefore unbounded wealth creation. And therefore, we can have unbounded wealth creation. And therefore, we can have continued to grow the number of human beings, not only on the planet, but throughout the cosmos and gradually gain control of more and more of it. Therefore, economics is not bounded by limited resources, although that's ostensibly what the subject is about. Of course, we do at any particular moment in time have finite resources. And so this is why we have this thing called economics, so that we can exchange goods and services one with another in order to distribute via the free market, these limited resources. However, this is the argument we're trying to make, where I try to marry up Deutsche's ideas of unbounded progress and the infinite capacity of people to create knowledge, explanatory knowledge, gaining control over the universe, turning hitherto useless materials into actual resources. Here's my attempt to marry all of that up with the subject of economics. After that, a little interlude of just 12 minutes worth of

### 44m

an introduction to epistemology and the theory of knowledge. So well worth listening to. For anyone who's brand new, for example, to epistemology, in particular to Popperian epistemology, which has nothing to do with justified true belief, justified belief or belief at all. Then we're back into creativity. And on the audio version, we're up to now episode 50 of TalkCast. And then into, again, one of the controversial chapters of the beginning of infinity. Of course, based upon reason, based upon our best understanding of science, it brings us to an appreciation of the fact that we're not just talking about science, it brings us to an appreciation of what human beings are capable of and what this thing is, the environment, and what those things are, resources. And this is chapter 17, Unsustainable, by David Deutsch. We hear this word, sustainable, that government policy should be sustainable, that we should have sustainable resources, that people should live sustainably. But what does this really mean? David Deutsch has his unique take on this, where there are two

### 45m

visions of what this word sustain means. On the one hand, to, keep things the same, to sustain them, to keep them in their present state. And on the other, to ensure that something has enough in order to thrive. And in the case of people, what we need in order to thrive is change. We cannot keep things the same. We cannot sustain things as they always have been. We are unsustainable. The earth cannot sustain us. The only way to survive, the only way to survive is to accept the fact that we are unsustainable. We are unsustainable. We are unsustainable. We must make progress, which means constant change, which means changing the universe around us from useless materials into resources, and then constructed into protections against a hostile environment, in order to make our lives better. And if we care about them, the lives of other animals and other entities as well. Because we're the only ones that are going to be able to

### 46m

save everything else from future catastrophes, whether those be asteroids from outer space, viruses, or the like. And we're the only ones that are going to be able to save everything else from future catastrophes, whether those be asteroids from outer space, viruses, or the supernova going off, or just eventually the sun expanding. Something is going to happen which will require much more knowledge and wealth than we currently have. Our circumstance is not sustainable. And so this is an argument against many of the pessimistic, bad philosophies that drive modern environmentalism, for example. Although I've done a discussion of the chapter on universality, I have produced in episode 53 of Topcast, and it's there on YouTube as well, an episode called Understanding Universality, trying to unpack it a little bit further and to clarify things. Sam Harris is very animated by this discussion of free will, and he insists that there is no free will. He's written a wonderful book, which is a defense of a position that I used to hold myself, that there was no free will. It was incompatible with determinism. I provide yet

### 47m

another episode about that, and free will response is a response to Sam Harris in particular, about that particular view. There's an episode that appears on YouTube there called Existence, just called Existence. And it is one of the first in the theme of making music videos, if you like. I put a soundtrack underneath some of these videos. I just happen to like this. I think that this works. Some people can't stand it. They don't want me to put music under any of my podcasts or videos whatsoever. And so a few of them, they appear twice. I'll get on to one of those in a moment. But Existence is about what it means for something to exist, what it means for something to be real under Deutsche's view of this, as explained in particular in The Fabric of Reality. So I go through that there. We continue with Unsustainable. We move on to something about existential risk, which also animates me, because I like to respond to the prevailing pessimism that exists out there as promoted by the intellectual luminaries of our

### 48m

time, people like Max Tegmark, Nick Bostrom, Martin Rees, unfortunately, as well. People who are narrowly focused on this concept of existential risk, but looking at it through a lens of either we're going to destroy ourselves or we're incapable of saving ourselves. And in either case, we need to be pessimistic about the future because eventually the thing's going to happen that's going to wipe us out. There is the existential risk, the civilization-level catastrophe that is coming. We stand on the other side of that debate, where although we recognize there are such things as existential risk, we're not going to be pessimists. We think people are the most powerful entities in the universe, ultimately speaking, and we can overcome everything from viruses and natural disasters here on Earth to being swallowed by black holes or being destroyed by a supernova. What is required is creating the knowledge of how to figure out how to do these things. We've already figured out how to prevent

### 49m

ourselves dying from the cold by creating houses that have heating, often heating provided by fossil fuels. We've already figured out how to prevent ourselves dying from the cold by creating fossil fuels. So we've done that. We've invented clothes. This will only continue, this open-ended ability to create a stream of solutions to the ever-increasing stream of problems that we encounter. As long as we continue to solve them at a rate faster than they're likely to kill us, then we can survive. And we will survive if we maintain optimism, the understanding there's a possibility that whatever the problem is, it can be solved with some effort. The final chapter of The Beginning of Infinity is called The Beginning. It's called The Beginning. And so I won't say any more about that now, but that brings us up to the end of, almost the end of my discussion of The Beginning of Infinity. Then there is one of my favorite episodes. And if I can be so immodest as to say, I think one of Naval's favorite episodes as well

### 50m

of TalkCast called The Nexus, which is about persons in the multiverse. I'm really focused on trying to understand the universe. And I'm really focused on trying to understand the universe. What this thing, a person is. Once we have an understanding of a person, then we can have a discussion about what genuinely AGI are. I don't know what an AGI is. I think it, I'm thinking more and more, it has to be beyond the mere purview of our present understanding of epistemology. It has to be beyond our conception even of programming. By which I mean, I think there's something to be said for, as I titled the episode, understanding what a person in the multiverse is. What does that mean? There are fungible instances of ourselves everywhere at every moment, coexisting with us that differentiate from us. What does that even mean? Well, I try and grapple with this in an hour long episode called Persons in the Multiverse. And that is,

### 51m

again, a soundtrack accompanied episode. I like the music. I think it adds something to the mood, but if you can't stand it, this is one of those ones where I've produced it in two forms. There is a no music version for those of you who can't stand my choice of music. Of course, there's issues with copyright, so I can only pick stuff that I've paid for. I have to actually pay for a license to use some of this music. After the beginning of infinity, I've then commenced discussing Chiara Marletto's The Science of Canon Cards. This is a wonderful introduction to David Deutsch's constructor theory. Chiara Marletto is the chief researcher, aside from David Deutsch, on constructor theory. She's written the first popular science book, and it's very accessible about constructor theory. And it goes through everything from what the theory is about through to our deepest understanding of what knowledge is at the moment as well. So I'll come to that later. I've done an episode on quasars, again, returning to my

### 52m

roots as someone trained in astrophysics, but also connecting the astrophysics to David Deutsch's epistemology and philosophy and physics, because he often invokes quasars as an example of something that is just so different from the physics of the human mind. And yet, it's the physics of the human mind that understands what is happening in that system that we call a quasar. And so connecting these two extremely different systems is a wonderfully deep fact about our universe that this thing can happen, that one, the mind, can come to resemble the other, a quasar. Alongside the science of can and can't, I also began my breakdowns of the fabric of reality. Fabric of reality, David Deutsch's first book, the first chapter of which is called The Theory of Everything. So that begins also on TopCast. I then make some remarks about crypto. I'm certainly not a Bitcoin expert, but I was

### 53m

absolutely fascinated as I dove into this. And Naval Ravikant gave me a good schooling in this, listening to his discussions with Tim Ferriss and Joe Rogan and various other places where he has discussed this at length. I became fascinated more by Ethereum than by Bitcoin because of the universality of Ethereum. And so I remarked, I made some remarks about crypto there, which might be insightful for some just because I'm coming at it from a computational universality perspective rather than anything else. But there are remarks there for anyone who's interested in crypto that might be interesting to you. And I think that's a good thing. And I think that's a good thing. It might be of interest to some people. Once I've completed The Beginning of Infinity altogether, I then interviewed David Deutsch. Of course I did. I had to talk to the man himself about The Beginning of Infinity. And so I have questioned him about the book and I split up the questions and made separate episodes with introductions by myself to each question that I asked him and then provided my question and then his answer as well. So including there's one there, David Deutsch

### 54m

comments on the research. So worth listening to David Deutsch about that. But also asked him a question about truth. This was something that Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris were at loggerheads about. So get David Deutsch's view on that. The Scientific American, just like Nature the Journal, now and again produces absolute rubbish when it comes to certain articles, editorials, whatever. Under the guise that it comes with the authority of science, often it doesn't. So in this episode, it's not scientific and it's not American. I explain what I think is wrong with a certain Scientific American article. And let's just say the whole culture that sometimes academia has with respect to resources and the role of humanity in the universe. I was interviewed by Christopher,

### 55m

the host of Do Explain, another podcast. Which has featured David Deutsch and various others within the community of people who promote his ideas. And so I was interviewed there in two parts. So that's up there on my website. We then move on to more about the fabric of reality. There's my discussion of chapter two, Shadows. Chapter two, Shadows, is where I always point people to. Chapter two of the fabric of reality is where I point people to if they really want to be persuaded of the multiverse. David Deutsch lays out a simple explanation. He says, I don't want to be persuaded of the multiverse. I want to do a real experiment there. That is a real experiment that can be done, that is done, that is done often as a demonstration. And this experiment can only be understood in terms of the multiverse view of quantum theory. I then do an ironic defense of socialism, a critique, if you like, as well. Some more science of canon carn, including the science of information. So I've got

### 56m

information theory spread over two parts. The second of my two parts is the science of interviews with Christopher of Vendoo Explain and so both of those together provide you with a background in certainly my perspective on things as informed by David Deutsch and Karl Popper and then we get to something quite academic indeed which is a paper by Karl Popper called The Aim of Science. The Aim of Science is a professional philosophical paper that he wrote and my breakdown of that over an hour and 13 minutes so if you're a real philosophy buff and you really want to get down into the nitty-gritty of what science genuinely is then this is the paper for you and of course I update it with what Deutsch has said in light of his discoveries especially in terms of the logic of experimental tests which I think is the as I say the pinnacle of our understanding of

### 57m

the philosophy of science. I've written over my years being involved in education on things like critical and creative thinking. I have my perspective on that. I think Karl Popper explained what critical and creative thinking are but now it's just a fashionable term that's used in academic circles and I think they often get it quite wrong so my view of critical and creative thinking is there in critical and creative thinking 2.0. So it's the updated version of my most recent thoughts on this. Chiara Maletto's Quantum Information Chapter 4 from the Science of Ken and Karl. What 2016 paper does to deem critical and creative thinking ground as postwar써 making from your own

### 58m

perspective? . Now we all know it's been 5 years sinceナ cannot have the final answer and that's a good thing that means that progress is always possible david has said that you know kind of popper might have only had one idea from which he derived everything else and this is the way in which the whole worldview of david deutsch kind of works but in terms of popper's philosophy popper had the idea that people encounter problems and then they want to solve them so this is the problem-centered approach of all of reason all of philosophy all of science all of mathematics is about having a problem and so the fabric of reality chapter three is called problem solving and it's very much an exploration of that and so this is my exploration of that chapter in two parts more questions from david and eventually i get to something called wealth and the conflict of ideas and wealth and the conflict of ideas is me discussing misconceptions about capitalism and the free market which i regard as synonymous and other people reject that notion

### 59m

that they are synonymous i think that they are i follow well a number of people in this but in particular euron brooke who i think is a wonderful expositor and defender of capitalism and you can marry this up with on the one hand my praise of him there with my critique of him in this one which is computational universality where euron brooke has a go at sam harris for his views on the mind and the idea that people's minds are or people's brains are meat computers which is something that sam harris says which is correct because of computational universality you have to understand that euron brooke doesn't unfortunately understand that he doesn't understand the physics and the universality of computation saying something is a computer like a mind is not denigrating it it's not denigrating it any more than saying it's made out of matter any more than saying that the brain contains 75 percent water that doesn't denigrate it it's just a it's just a fact that the brain is computing stuff

### 1h 0m

now it's doing something very different to every other computer but that doesn't mean it's not a computer it's got a special kind of software which call the mind on anyway so if you want to see my discussion of what euron thinks of sam and what sam's view of the mind is and where it might be flawed this is my explanation of that in light of what david deutsch has said about computational universality explanatory universality and the possibility of creating knowledge which is what people do here i begin also to explain the concept of computational universality and the my discussion of stephen pinker's rationality chapters one and two stephen pinker is a world renowned intellectual and author who presents in his book rationality one of his more recent books the pristine version of what academics and your typical intellectual thinks about this term rationality and how to think correctly and properly in an erudite way so that you make fewer errors and that kind of thing well

### 1h 1m

here's my view about all of that let's just say that although of course in order for a person to have such success as stephen pinker sam harris for that matter anyone in academia they have to know something about reason they have to understand knowledge there can still be errors they do make errors they don't understand popper and indeed stephen pinker basically just ignores the existence of popper in deutsch for that matter although he was a great proponent of the work of david deutsch he was a he has praised the big work the the the beginning of infinity before but to be honest when he writes about these topics in rationality it's as if he never read the book i'm sure he did but one of two things might have happened one he may have forgotten everything that he read there or two he read into the book something that he expected to read he expected to see stuff about justified true belief and so on and so forth and he didn't

### 1h 2m

understand conjectural knowledge and so he didn't understand this is why i do the podcast you see the reason that top cast exists is for people like stephen pinker very intelligent people my audience who perhaps don't have time like me or the interest to read the book i don't know how many times now dozens of times i've listened to the audiobook dozens of times it took me a long time to really grapple with what was being said and what was being said and what was being said and so not only did i have to produce a podcast if i think understand it better but the podcast now serves as don't make the same mistakes as everyone else who reads it only once and doesn't quite get it take the lead from someone like navarra avocan who has says he's carrying around these two books the beauty infinity and the fabric of reality uh because they kind of serve as critiques of every other book out there like rationality for example so you don't need to read the book

### 1h 3m

read those other books i do because i'm just interested in finding out where the errors are what these people are thinking but these two other books these the beginning infinity in the fabric of reality allow you to just spot errors everywhere else and to have an excellent understanding of our deepest knowledge and so therefore you can see the errors that people are making and you can see the opportunities for progress and the opportunities for moving forward where others don't okay and so more about the science of cancun my favorite chapter from the science of cancun is there about knowledge and chiara describing knowledge as resilient information information that remains in place over time and actually can become the most resilient structure in the universe eventually there will be the thing that persists over time because it's useful because we will preserve it we get to my retrospective episode 99 of top cast and there on youtube it is

### 1h 4m

one hour 39 minutes and one second so 99 minutes exactly hard to edit that to get it just right but it's my retrospective where i actually go through every single chapter and provide a summary of just the beginning infinity and that's followed by episode 100 the celebration episode where my the the interview with david deutsch in its entirety is there so previously i just had separate episodes with an introduction by me to each of the questions but this contains more content a more content than just the other ones as well episode 101 was my first ama first ask me anything just what you get uh after that was something i called the thin veneer again another one of these music videos where joe rogan is in conversation with blair white and joe rogan says some i find joe just such a wonderfully curious fellow highly intelligent but his mind is open to possibilities you know without fully

### 1h 5m

enforcing craziness okay so sometimes he goes a bit far with the alien thing but so what i think this is good he's not saying that he i've listened to enough episodes of joe rogan to know that he's an entertainer and just a curious guy he's not a full-on conspiracy theorist anyway so what i'm responding to here is something he says which i just find because he's a spiritual kind of a guy but it syncs up with what i regard as a realistic conception of the world informed by some of the content in david deutsch's book david deutsch's work allows for mystery and a sense of awe at the cosmos it's not a narrow denuded of inspiration view of science it is quite the opposite it is grand wondrous vision about what people are and what the cosmos and our place within amount to i then do another ama then the highly provocative

### 1h 6m

episode that i'm often tweeting out on twitter which is are we running out of resources my answer is no and i explain why more fabric of reality stuff i try to succinctly explain what is a good explanation succinctly in 20 minutes i then began a newsletter and so you can find my newsletter on substack it contains different content to what is on top cast that's very intermittent it's just well stuff that takes my interest that might not fit within the top cast feed but the first episode the name of the newsletter is the three r's reality reason and rationality and so an introduction to that is actually in the top cast feed more about rationality than some more newsletter stuff one of my favorite episodes that i've produced that i'm i guess i'm proud of is objective knowledge here as an audio only version but it's there on youtube as well but you don't get to see my head just listen to my voice

### 1h 7m

this is my understanding of the state of play of what objective knowledge is in 2022 2023 2024 this is where i think the state of play is now with objective objective knowledge was a book written by popper to explain his vision of knowledge and how it is created and how it is checked against reality and so forth david deutsch updated this and so this is my synthesis of these two great minds and what i think is the state of play of what objective knowledge is and how it is we can say objective knowledge is so i've called it an explanation for the 21st century more newsletters then we get to work and heat where i do a little a little demonstration about heat pumps and and engines heat engines uh this is again thermodynamics from the science of cannon cart more newsletters something about energy another ask me anything then after some fabric of reality we get to origins again there's a music version there's a

### 1h 8m

non-music version this is about the first images that were released by jwst the james webb space telescope very exciting for anyone who's ever had any interest in astrophysics whatsoever is the new space telescope that's up there so this is my scientific explanations of what these images are these first images that came out i love doing reaction videos and in fact everyone loves me doing reaction videos they are among my most popular videos is when i tackle other broadcasters in particular when i tackle what sam harris might have said i don't like to pour scorn on sam harris i have great respect for sam harris he is one of of course the most important voices of our time but i do think he makes errors and i do think that he can tend in the direction of pessimism and i think it needs to be answered his audience is obviously far greater than mine he has far greater reach and this needs to be answered and so when he produces episodes like the end of the global order which was just the end of the global order which was just the end of the global order

### 1h 9m

about how the world's going to end so many of his episodes are about how the world's going to end it's very pessimistic i feel i need to say something and people seem to enjoy it i've got another one of those coming out soon after this in fact it might be the episode after this where i'm going to do a breakdown of yet another discussion that sam harris has with someone so the end of global order if you want to hear me talking about and responding to the content of a making sense podcast with sam harris more from stephen pinker it's basically a critique at this one so i'm as i'm slowly making my way through rationality i'm up to now chapter five and six where i think pink is just getting the wrong end of the stick on what what it means to be rational he thinks that we need to believe something based upon the weight of the evidence and i think something quite different following what david deutch says in the beginning of infinity i then have more analysis of another paper by carl popper some more newsletter stuff and then i produced a very long series about again a very long series about how the world's going to end and i think

### 1h 10m

this is another analysis of a sam harris conversation this time with max tegmark where i've called it things that make you go hmm and because every episode that i produced it seemed to be about something beginning with m so we've got metaphysics and misconceptions we've got mathematics and multiverses we've got minds one and two and so you can have a look at this entire series of podcasts here i found it a lot of fun it's clips of sam and max talking about stuff and you know max likes to talk about different versions of the multiverse and you know i sort of take him to task over the extent to which some are scientific and some aren't his view of mathematics which is informed by his view of physics which i think is mistaken his view of computation his understanding of what metaphysics is and the role of knowledge in our capacity to create explanatory knowledge and all this sort of stuff and of course of course sam and max are on the same page largely when it comes to this question of

### 1h 11m

super intelligence and agi and i think they are terribly misconceived terribly mistaken about this in a dangerous way quite seriously then i began to produce shorts these short videos here which are yeah snippets if you want i suppose if you're getting bored of me talking for hours at a time here's something much shorter and more brief finally i've completed the series on a science of canon carp by kiara marletta i'm yet to interview kiara but at some point i will have a discussion with her i then move on to discussing objectivist epistemology because it's the one that people bring up most often on social media whenever they try and engage me in discussions about the work of david deutsch and in particular the epistemology of karl popper and david deutsch they say but hold on ayn rand has already explained objective knowledge objectivist epistemology and i think there are no real advances or insights in

### 1h 12m

the epistemology of ayn rand that go beyond what other people who came before her said she attempts to use induction and the way she explains things is the way that many other philosophers have explained things before but i go to her sources and quote her and then explain why i think she and her followers in objectivism get epistemology wrong i think they get a lot of other stuff right in fact i think they do a reasonable job in the area of morality improving things there and they do a reasonable job in in talking about realism but they get epistemology wrong and so respectfully i i go through um quoting not only ayn rand but also other people who claim expertise in objectivism other philosophers of objectivism at some point david deutsch won a prestigious prize called the breakthrough prize for his contributions to quantum information and quantum computation

### 1h 13m

and so there's an episode there called breakthrough prize or who is david deutsch so if you want an introduction to david deutsch there we go 19 minutes worth of an introduction to david deutsch there's an episode called carl popper versus the rest and then i get into a lengthy discussion about this paper that appears in the book conjectures and refutations right at the beginning there but it appears elsewhere as well called on the sources of knowledge and of ignorance by carl popper and so i explain knowledge and ignorance because i think that's a very important it is the preeminent contribution that popper made to epistemology in a succinct way but again it's written at a time and in a style where english was subtly different and so although mere decades have passed it's a long enough time and especially because he's writing in a style of professional philosophy even though i find him far clearer than most other philosophers that sometimes it'd be difficult to unpack and it's important to unpack these things i think for the lay person to understand still making my way through the fabric of the book and i think it's

### 1h 14m

a reality and so we're up to the significance of life still making my way through pink as rationality and so up to chapter seven there as well knowledge and ignorance goes on for you know five episodes that continues another effectively and ask me anything kind of episode but i i talk about tweets on twitter that that have caught my eye over recent times a really important episode that i find is one that i produced called degrowth where i unpack an article in nature this article in nature is somewhere it sits somewhere between just complete opinion editorial and peer-reviewed journal paper it's hard to tell the way that nature the journal passes it off it would seem as if it's a peer-reviewed piece of research but it's a political treatise and so i take issue with that especially with this dangerous philosophy of degrowth an hour and a half i explain what

### 1h 15m

degrowth is i explain what degrowth is and i explain what degrowth is and i explain what degrowth is and i explain my criticisms of it and i have a laugh along the way so um if you're interested in degrowth the plan for civilizational decline and disaster have a look at that one it's got quite a few views as far as my videos go small time channel but you know as of today's date you know 24th of march 2023 1 300 views three months ago so that one i quite enjoyed making and i think people have enjoyed watching it i always say i can't take credit for the ideas that i assume i can't take credit for the ideas that i assume i can't take credit for the ideas that i take responsibility for the errors that i make but i'm not often presenting anything unique here i'm not a professional philosopher i'm not a professional physicist if anything i'm a communicator a conduit of ideas i repackage things but here in this episode consciousness and creativity a relatively recent one 17 minutes and 30 seconds worth it's got 2300 views that's pretty good for me this one i take a bit of a leap i'm conjecturing

### 1h 16m

things myself about the nature of consciousness and about the nature of creativity and whether these things are the same thing or not so although i am certainly riffing on what david has said in the beginning of infinity i am substantively going a little further so i'm not saying that this is what david said you know in fact in none of my episodes should i say that except where i'm quoting him i'm very careful to quote him but in this one in particular this is all me or largely me anyway listen to that for my views on consciousness if you happen to be interested in that kind of a thing another professional philosophical paper is discussed this one about the nature of philosophy itself and the debate between wittgenstein who thought that all of philosophy reduced to language puzzles this is the linguistic school and popper who thought there were genuine philosophical problems philosophy actually solves stuff that is important for people to survive and thrive and for science to continue to do its work so this is

### 1h 17m

a great debate and so this is my discussion of that particular debate knowledge and ignorance goes on to part six where i reach the conclusion and then a you know another talking twitter another ama style thing and then a really fun episode uh knowledge for the next millennium a message for the next millennium 28 minutes and 37 seconds of me warning people about the end times so uh that one's more light-hearted but with obviously a deep message from the theme that runs through you know all the top cast here population three stars this is the first of my episodes in science news from a critical rationalist perspective so to speak i'm going to be doing these regularly as regularly as i can to fit it in between all the other stuff that i do as you can see top cast is rather strange as i said so i'm i'm beginning to do news because i know that other science popularizers are out there doing science news and the way in

### 1h 18m

which they present it it's either like they're presenting it as religion or as an authority something like that i want to withhold judgment on these things and to say where it is we know something and where it is we don't know something we're up to quantum computers as of the day i'm making this when it comes to the fabric of reality part two there will have to be a part three then a discussion of an academic paper by david deutsch david deutsch wrote a paper called it from qubit this was in response to a paper by his mentor one of his mentors one of the people who inspired him john wheeler the great physicist who wrote a paper in which a thesis was presented called it from it from bit it from bit and john wheeler's hypothesis conjecture there was the at base everything was information and not physical and i discussed david deutsch's response to that thesis and then i'm up to today and so this is now where we're up to

### 1h 19m

today an experimental test of the quantum multiverse which was taken from my multiverse series for anyone who was watching anyone who's listening to the tim ferris interview who might have wanted more information about that so this is what talk cast is as of now and talk cast will continue on discussing the work of david deutsch we have more to discuss from the fabric of reality i want to get through rationality by stephen pinker tidy things up there explain why those main things are not real and why they're not real and why they're not real and why they're not are wrong continue to have interaction with people via ask me anything episodes as well but that'll do for today as always if you would like to support me www.bretthall.org is the web page and there are links there to patreon and paypal but until next time bye
