Welcome to TopCast and to part three of things that make you go hmm my exploration of thematics morality multiverses as this one will be about metaphysics and many other things that are covered in the conversation between Max Tegmark and Sam Harris. As I keep saying it's a wonderful conversation go looking online for the podcast if you sign up as a member of Sam's community then you get access to the entire podcast which is what I've got access to or you can buy the book of conversations which includes the conversations with David Deutsch that's part one of the book and there's an audio version of it and Max Tegmark as well which is the very last part of the book so as I said before two great thinkers to begin and end a journey through the Making Sense series. Today this one is about multiverse now I've got an entire series online about the multiverse the multiverse as I understand it what

### 1m

we know exists is what is known as the Everettian multiverse the quantum multiverse the what the multiverse that is explained in the fabric of reality and the beginning of infinity that quantum physicists talk about so it is said an interpretation of quantum theory we don't regard it as an interpretation any more than one would say dinosaurs are an interpretation of fossils in a sense they are but there is no other viable interpretation now of course many physicists many quantum physicists will disagree with this kind of thing and say oh no they don't endorse the multiverse now sometimes this means they're an instrumentalist in which case they're not endorsing any particular interpretation they are retreating from interpretations full stop and hence explanations full stop they're only interested in predictions so they say so they claim and I would just say of that it's completely irrational because they're not interested in predictions they're not interested in explanations you need to understand what you're doing simply being able to predict the outcome of

### 2m

experiments is not understanding and explaining reality and even if we don't have a perfect explanation of reality your job as a scientist should be at least in part to try and understand reality to give us the best explanation that's one thing other physicists who deny the reality of the multiverse and try and come up with their own version what they end up doing when you look at the details something like boehm's pilot wave theory I've read quite a few interventions interpretations over my time. Paul Davies has that wonderful book, Ghost in the Atom, where he goes through a large number of interpretations. There's been a few popular science books written recently, I think they get written every other year, about, you know, some physicist's pet favorite interpretation, one they've made up. Well, these all fall into two categories. They're either going to be of the instrumentalist bent, where they're just denying that you can have a proper interpretation and so just calculate. That's one way the popular scientists do it, and the physicists. And the other is just to disguise the multiverse in some way, shape,

### 3m

or form. It's the multiverse in heavy disguise, as David Deutsch likes to say. What happens is they postulate the existence of things you can't observe. In other words, physical reality, the reality we inhabit and the reality we have access to, in a sense, directly, is being impinged upon by other entities. in reality that we can't observe. So these other entities in reality, although these physicists and these popularizers of science might say things like, I don't endorse the multiverse, I think that's a proliferation of universes, it violates Occam's razor, or it's just crazy metaphysics or whatever. Nonetheless, their own interpretation tends to invoke the existence of stuff you don't have experimental access to in quite the same way. You have to infer its existence. And all we say about that is, well, yeah, you're inferring it. You're inferring it. You're inferring it. You're inferring the existence of stuff. Okay, that other stuff occupies a different space. It's not here now, but it's having an effect on the stuff you do observe, the stuff you do see. You're

### 4m

explaining why you get interference effects, because something's affecting the path of those photons or those electrons or those particles. Something that you can't see, but you're saying it really exists. That's the multiverse. Now you can call it whatever else you like. You can call those other things by Christian names if you prefer. But the fact is, they exist. You're saying they exist. And that's what we say the multiverse is. Now, we have a richer explanation, a coherent explanation that just says, well, for each particle you do observe, there are counterparts of that particle, fungible instances which can differentiate themselves and thereby cause interference. So whatever the case, this is the Everettian multiverse, which, as I say, it's unusual in that Max Tegmark does endorse a version of this, but it's the one kind of multiverse that is not talked about, really. It's not really referred to. It's not really referred to. It's not really referred to here in the Making Sense podcast with Max Tegmark. So a lot of this part of the conversation between Sam and Max, I'm skipping past. In fact, I've missed an entire bit, and I'm not

### 5m

going to talk about it at all, where they do discuss information and its relationship to mathematics. I'm going to skip over that. And here as well, I think I can skip through a lot of the multiverse stuff, because if you go back to part one of my treatment of this conversation, what you will see there is that I basically summarized the four levels of multiverse, that Max endorses in some way or other, and I talk about it there. So I won't go through that again now. I'll let Max just speak, and then he moves on to the simulation hypothesis, and I'll have a few things to say about that. So let's get into the discussion today. I now want to get into the multiverse, which is probably the strangest concept in science now. It's something that I thought I understood before picking up your book, and then I discovered there were three more flavors. of multiverse than I realized existed. I want to talk about the multiverse, but first, let's just start with the universe, because this is a term around which there is some confusion. Let's just

### 6m

get our bearings. What do we mean, or what should we mean by the term universe? And I want to start with your level one multiverse. So if it's possible, give us a brief description of the concept of inflation that gets us there. Sure. So what is our universe, first of all, before we start talking about it? So what is our universe, first of all, before we start talking about it? So what is our universe, first of all, before we start talking about it? So what is our universe, first of all, before we start talking about others? Many people sort of tacitly assume that universe is a synonym for everything that exists. And if so, by definition, there can't be anything more. And talk about the universes would just be silly, right? But that is, in fact, not what people generally in cosmology mean when they say universe. When they say our universe, they mean the spherical region of space from which light has had time to reach us so far during the 13.8 billion years since our Big Bang. So that's, in other words, Everything we could possibly see, even with unlimited funding for telescopes. And so if that's our universe, we can reasonably ask, well, is there more space beyond that, you know, from which light has not yet reached us but might reach us tomorrow or in a billion years?

### 7m

And if there is, if space goes on far beyond this, if it's infinite or just vastly larger than the space we can see, then all these other regions, which are as big as our universe, if they also have galaxies and planets in them and so on, it would be kind of arrogant to not call them universes as well, because the people who live there will call that their universe. Unfair or misleading in a way? You see, Max defines into existence there something that, as someone who trained in astronomy, and far be it from me to quibble with a world renown, cosmologist, but what I was taught throughout my degrees in this was that we know as a matter of Big Bang and inflation cosmology,

### 8m

that of course there is this thing, the observable universe, which Max defines quite rightly there as the region of space where light has had time to reach us. But we know as a matter of fact that that's not all of space, that continuous with that and continuing to expand is space beyond that. Continuous with that. It's just that delight. It hasn't had time to reach us from that particular region just yet. So you can go all the way to the deepest recesses of space. I don't know how far it is. 40 billion light years away. By the way, it's further than 13.7 billion light years because of inflation, because of the expansion of the universe. So from here to the furthest away possible is something like 40 billion light years, whatever, this spherical region of space. But we know there's space beyond that. The theory tells us that. And then, in fact, because space is expanding at those furthest, farthest reaches. It's faster than the speed of light and space can expand faster than the speed of light. Einstein's theory of relativity says you cannot move through space faster than the speed of light, but space itself can expand faster than the speed of light.

### 9m

So there are galaxies there at the edge of the universe which are moving beyond, being expanded beyond what we can see. So that might be visible today, but cannot possibly be visible tomorrow because they've disappeared beyond the horizon of light where light can reach us. So we know this is going on. This is a matter of science. This is a matter of normal science. So this is why generally when this kind of material is taught to students of astronomy and cosmology, they're taught. So therefore, you've got this observable universe, this ring, and then out of that is another concentric ring, concentric sphere would be more precise, of a region of space perfectly continuous with that, which contains galaxies and planets and all that other stuff, all the stuff that we see, but it just goes on even further beyond what we can see. So that's all the universe. Okay. The physical universe is that thing, and that's usually what astronomers, astrophysicists, cosmologists refer to as the universe, and they distinguish that from the observable universe.

### 10m

That's why, to be honest, it's just idiosyncratically Max Tegmark, as far as I'm aware, who refers to this as the level one multiverse. So it just seems a bizarre way of confusing people, and people already object to the idea of multiverse. But so it's kind of, it's a little off-putting, which is why, you know, people just say. Let's talk about the universe, just everything that exists. Some stuff that exists, we can't see, and we've talked about that ad nauseum on here. So this is why I say level one multiverse, I don't know if it counts as a multiverse. It's more like just the universe. And the strange thing is, Max concedes as much himself soon in this conversation. He just says, well, the level one multiverse, that's just another way of talking about space. Space. So the only reason for the term here seems to be. To distinguish between the region of space that's observed or observable in principle, and the region of space that is not observable in principle. But if that's the criterion, a spatially connected region that's not observable in principle, scientifically,

### 11m

well, it's the core of a typical star, another universe in some sense. Is the innards of a black hole another universe in some sense? Well, of course, some cosmologists might actually argue that. Well, the innards of a neutron star, then. You know, not observable. In principle, we don't have any good explanation about how you would even go about beginning to build an instrument that would be able to get there. Another universe? No, I think this is misleading. This is just an unnecessary use of a term which should be used precisely. And in science, we want precision with our terms, to the extent that we can get precision. Yes, everything is ambiguous and all that sort of stuff. Granted, we should try and have an economy of terminology, especially precise scientific terminology. I think it just degrades things. We just start. Throwing the words around everywhere. All right. I've made enough of a point on that. We'll come back to it again shortly. Let's keep going anyway.

### 12m

And inflation is very linked to this because it's the best theory we have for what created our Big Bang and made our space the way it is, so vast and so expanding. And it actually predicts generically that space is not just really big, but vast, and in most cases, actually infinite. And that's what we call our universe. Which would mean, if inflation actually happened, that what we call our universe is really just a small part of a much bigger space. So, in other words, space, then, is much bigger than the part of space that we call our universe. And this is something, actually, I don't think is particularly weird once one gets the terminology straight because it's just history all over again, right? We humans have been the masters of underestimation. We've had this overinflated ego where we want to put ourselves in a position where we're not going to be able to do anything. We've had this overinflated ego where we want to put ourselves in a position where we're not going to be able to do anything. We've had this overinflated ego where we want to put ourselves in the center and assume that everything that we know about is everything that exists. And we've been proven wrong again and again and again, discovering that everything we thought existed is just a small part of a much grander structure.

### 13m

A planet, solar system, a galaxy, a galaxy cluster, our universe, and maybe also a hierarchy now of parallel universes. So, Max is, of course, quite right there about the history. And it's a point I've made here on TalkCast many times before. The history of science, the history of physics, cosmology in particular, astronomy, is this history of gradually our understanding becoming ever larger of stuff. Our understanding. And so, we used to think it was just basically planet Earth with celestial spheres and we didn't know what they were. But then we figured out we actually occupy this thing called the solar system, which is bigger than the planet. And we realized, well, the solar system is actually inside this thing called the galaxy. Oh, the galaxy. Well, it's just one. Among many galaxies. Got this whole thing called the universe. And, well, it shouldn't be much of a surprise that we have this multiverse. Now, the only sense in which I disagree kind of with Max here, I think, is that the proper epistemology allows you to distinguish between what's known in the sense of having a good explanation, a solution that solves a particular problem and no longer has any rivals.

### 14m

And so, therefore, you say it is the explanation of something. And competing hypotheses where you don't really know. And you don't even have a method of being able to test for these things just yet. And you can't rule out the alternatives. That's a key thing. You can't rule out the alternatives just yet. So, you can't say you know these things. So, these are not all on equal footing. These levels of multiverses are not on equal footing for that reason. But the way that Max talks, it's as if, it's as if they're kind of, you know, these all exist. And, you know, you buy one, so why won't you buy the other ones? Well, because some of them are well-known good explanations. And you can solve a particular problem. Because that level one multiverse, which I just, again, insist on calling the universe. It solves a particular problem. It enables us to explain observations of the actual universe that we have in cosmology, like the cosmic microwave background.

### 15m

Like the ratio of hydrogen to helium that we observe out there in outer space. Like the expansion, the redshift of galaxies, the expansion of space. So, it solves these things. So, the dark night sky is another one. So, this is solved by postulating and expanding the universe. So, this is solved by postulating and expanding the universe. And a universe, therefore, beyond what we can actually observe. So, that solves the problem. The Everettian multiverse solves the problem. It's like, how do we explain the observations of things like interference experiments? Everettian multiverse. We need to invoke the existence of these paralleled other universes that contain fungible instances of every single particle. Okay. So, that's that. But then when we get into these other ones, these level two multiverses, and especially level four multiverse. They are hypotheses that aren't. Yet, that don't yet count as good explanations. Why? Well, because in the case of, let's take level four. Let's take level four. The level four multiverse is, is this idea that all different physical laws exist out there somewhere or other.

### 16m

So, all the logically possible universes are out there somewhere or other. Now, the overwhelming majority of those are governed by physical laws, which are completely hostile to life. So, why would you think this thing up? Well, one reason you would think up this plenitude, these other universes with other physical laws, is to solve the problem of why? Why the constants of nature here in our universe appear to be finely tuned. Now, I think the fine-tuning problem is a problem, but there is a debate in physics between physicists, some of whom say, well, it's not a problem. But here's the thing. We don't know the answer to this fine-tuning problem. We don't know why the constants appear to have been finely tuned to allow for life here in this universe. Change any of the constants, Max will come to this, and you won't get life. Change them by too much and you won't get life. But here we are. It seems a reminder. It's a remarkable coincidence that conditions are just right. We're in the Goldilocks zone, not only for one constant, but for all the constants. That's remarkable. It's a remarkable thing. One such solution is, well, you've got this multiverse of all the other universes with different physical laws, most of which don't have life.

### 17m

So, why should we be surprised if all the other universes are out there? Of course, we're going to find ourselves in the one that is very bio-friendly. It's friendly towards life and intelligence. Okay. Now, truth be told, you don't even need level four for this. You just need Max's so-called... Level two multiverse, which he's coming to shortly. But he switches between these things pretty fast in this conversation. So, sometimes it's hard to keep track. Level two is just the class of universes defined by all solutions to string theory or something like that. Whatever. All our physical constants, they still exist in those other universes, but they take on all possible values somewhere or other in that multiverse. But presumably, quantum theory and general relativity, they still hold, or string theory still holds. So, the laws themselves are the same, the form of the laws, but the constants are not. So, this is one way of arguing about fine-tuning and one way of solving, in scare quotes, the problem of fine-tuning.

### 18m

We find ourselves in the universe, or in one of the small number of universes, where the constants are just right. And all the others actually exist out there somewhere or other. Of course, you could have wildly different constants and wildly different physical laws. Making a bio-friendly universe. And then you might get life. But that's level four. Indeed, in level four, you might not even have constants at all. Who knows what goes on in level four. You just have every logically possible universe. Every logically possible thing. In sum, magic really does work. The Star Wars universe is actually out there. Literally real in this level four universe. Universes violating conservation laws. And universes where you can go through space. It's faster than light. Ad infinitum. Ad infinitum in every single sense there. That's called the plenitude. David Lewis wrote a book, like I said, about this. This, by the way, makes the plenitude easy to vary.

### 19m

The plenitude, all logically possible universes, or what Max calls the ultimate ensemble. Anything that, in his mind, is even conceivable. But I would say, actually, conceivable is too limited a word for this. Maybe what is inconceivable still exists. And still exists. And still counts as possible. Why is our ability to conceive it a constraint on what logical reality is as a whole? I doubt we can get agreement on what counts as conceivable or logically possible. Is God, the Christian God, logically possible? What about Zeus? What about other creator gods? If they're logically possible, if they obey logic, then they exist out there somewhere or other. And they're creating universes. And presumably our own, too, in an infinite number of universes. Or if these gods are not logical, never mind physical, then what is logically possible? And are other logics permitted in these other logically possible universes? After all, what we consider logical is what is knowable to us as logical in this universe,

### 20m

obeying these laws of physics. Perhaps in other universes with other laws of physics, they can compute stuff which includes coming to know things that includes an understanding of a logic deeper than ours or different to ours. This is quickly becoming... Unbending self-referential stuff. Illogical, perhaps. So, whatever the case, maybe then Yahweh doesn't seem so strange to you now. Maybe the Hindu gods don't seem so strange anymore. By any measure, the plenitude, the level four multiverse, is far stranger. Because it includes Yahweh and all the Hindu gods and every other set of gods that you like who created our world. Whatever the case. These multiverses are argued for on the basis of... Fine-tuning. It's the only reason I ever see them being invoked. But, well, aside from in purely philosophical discussions. But they only come into physics in this particular way. By trying to solve fine-tuning.

### 21m

But fine-tuning remains a problem still. Because many physicists don't agree with this particular solution. And quite right too. Because, as I say, it's not a good explanation. I don't think this solves the problem. Most don't think this solves the problem by this explanation. It's not a good explanation. It's too easy to vary. But, in fact, so are the alternatives to it. These multiverses, especially the number four multiverse, they're easy to vary. Like, people will vary on what is conceivable. Or logical. Or possible in that way. Because they're not constrained by physics. They're not even constrained by imagination. And maybe level four consists of the infinite class of logically possible universes. But just not the one where the electron has double the value. Of what it does in our universe. I mean, that's a logically possible multiverse, right? So that's easy to vary. Maybe they all exist except for that one. Or they all exist except for that one. And where the electron has a charge of triple hours.

### 22m

Ad infinitum, as I say. Anyway, there are at least two other competing theories for this. That's a wild claim. Every possible reality exists out there somewhere. Pretty wild claim. I think it's less wild, to be honest with you. I think it's less wild to postulate the fact that, a God created this universe. A God created this universe. Now, why is it less wild? Well, because if every logically possible universe exists out there somewhere, that includes universes created by gods. Universes created by gods. So if you postulate every logically possible universe, logically possible, not physically possible, logically possible, it's logically possible that you can have all powerful beings out there somewhere or other. It's logically possible. I can imagine it. If you can imagine, it's logically possible, right? I don't see a contradiction in that. Other people are going to say, oh, there's a contradiction. Okay, well, let's have something less than an omnipotent. Okay, but godlike beings are out there. For all intents and purposes, godlike beings occupy that multiverse. So isn't it more parsimonious to just say,

### 23m

rather than have an infinite number of godlike beings, let's have one godlike being that created this universe. Seems more parsimonious. So these are two of the competing claims. Now, there's at least a third I know, which is that the physical laws here are bio-friendly, and we appear the way that we do, because, it's mathematically necessarily required. And whatever the successor to quantum theory and general relativity is, or the successor to the successor of that, will turn out to just have a set of equations, which require as a matter of mathematical necessity, logical necessity, that the constants have the values that they do. And so if this is the case, well, that rules out the plenitude, the multiverse of multiverses, so to speak. We don't know, but the way that the way that some popularizers, some people in this very conversation are talking, it's as if that level four multiverse, it counts just as well as the level one multiverse, and the level three multiverse. And I just don't think that it does. I don't think that it does. We're not distinguishing between these different kinds of universes,

### 24m

multiverses rather, in the way that we should. What is known, not known to be true, but known as our best explanation, known to be a good explanation of the observed facts, and what is just one of many competing hypotheses that you would invoke a multiverse for. But there could be other solutions that rule out, that refute that multiverse. So we're going to pick it up where Max begins to talk about inflation theory, which is interesting. I'll have some things to say about what he says about inflation theory here, and also his own sort of, well, walking back to a certain extent of what this level one multiverse in scare quotes happens to be. So let's see what Max has to say. First, it's a great illustration of one of the cool things, and science where you start with some pretty innocent assumptions, namely here that space just goes on forever, like most of us thought as kids. And moreover, that things started out a little bit randomly everywhere. And you get this totally shocking conclusion.

### 25m

If when I go ask my colleagues, I would say the vast majority of them would put their money on that some form of inflation happened, and that our space is actually much bigger than our universe. Whether it's actually infinite or just really huge starts getting a little bit more controversial. And we would love to also we also don't know for sure, of course, whether inflation actually happened. But this is this is sort of the simplest version of the theory where space simply goes on forever. It's an infinite space, much like Euclid's space or the one we thought about as kids. And in the book, I call this the level one multiverse. But you can just use the synonym space for it. And if and just to drill down a little bit more and where the craziness comes in, if you have, if you look at the way our universe got this way and the way our podcast came about by this, because we had about 10 to the power 78 quarks and electrons here that started out in a particular way, somewhat random early on after inflation,

### 26m

which led to the formation of our solar system and our planet and our parents met and so on. And we met and then this this happened, right? If you'd started the quarks out a little bit differently, things would have unfolded differently. And you can actually count up how many different ways you can arrange the quarks and electrons. In our universe. And it turns out it's only about a Googleplex different ways where Googleplex is one with a Google zero is Google is one of the hundred zeros. It's a huge number, but it's finite. So if you have an infinite number of other regions equally big and you start, you roll the dice again and all of them, then as you can calculate that, if you go about a Googleplex meters away, you will indeed end up with just what you described the universe. That's extremely similar to this one, except that one minute ago you all of a sudden decided to start speaking Hungarian instead. So there's three things I want to say about what's just been said there.

### 27m

The first is that Max says that you can't know for sure about whether or not inflation is actually the explanation of the beginning of the universe. And as we say here, well, if that's your standard, knowing for sure, then you won't know anything at all. Now inflation is an interesting kind of an explanation. I would say we know the big bang occurred and I would actually also tend in the direction of saying that we know inflation happened as well. I just don't think there are any other viable competitors at the moment. We need to explain observations, observations of stuff like the cosmic microwave background. Now the cosmic microwave background has this feature of being exceedingly smooth. And what exceedingly smooth? Means is that when you map the slight temperature variations in the empty space between galaxies, this is the cosmic microwave background radiation, the heat leftover, the residual heat leftover from the big bang will actually, you look far enough off into the distance to about 300,000 years after the big bang.

### 28m

And you get this map, you get this map of the sky. This is what COBE, the cosmic microwave background Explorer and WMAP, the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe. And recently the, the plank telescope, the, these satellites that are up there mapping this cosmic microwave background, whatever the case, what we find is that it's about 2.7 Kelvin. This is 2.7 degrees Celsius above absolute zero. But there are fluctuations in the temperature, slightly warm in this region, slightly cooler in this region, but those fluctuations are so small that the smallness of the fluctuations cries out for an explanation because the quantum cosmologists say that, well, when the universe was smaller than an atom, then there would have been these fluctuations. The fluctuations should have caused greater temperature differences. If you just rely upon classical big bang theory, the regular big bang theory should have magnified these temperature differences. But instead we don't see these huge temperature differences.

### 29m

We see very small temperature differences. So why are there small and not huge temperature differences? Well, inflation theory, inflation theory explains that. And we have no other explanation as far as I'm aware of, why it is that we observe what we do. So we've got this observation that cries out for an explanation. We have only one explanation. Now, someone comes up with a rival, then we would need to have a crucial experiment test that could decide between the theories, but we don't have any other theory. So the only known explanation for why we're getting this smoothness in the cosmic microwave background amongst other things, by the way, amongst other things, you can go Googling or Wikipedia inflationary cosmology, the inflation theory, which is just a version of the big bang theory. And what you learn is that there are observations that are, explained by inflation theory, but not explained by anything else. And so this is important. So this is why I would say it's quite right and reasonable to say we know inflation happened as we know the big bang happened. As we know, evolution by natural selection happens. These are the only known explanations of the observations that we have.

### 30m

Now, do we know these things for sure? No. Again, if that's your standard, well, you're always going to be disappointed in science and everywhere else. Notice also that there, Max admits what I was complaining about earlier. Which is that this level one multiverse, not really a multiverse. He just says there, it's a synonym for space. Quite right. I think that's quite right that he should say that. But then he also says a thing that I might quibble with just a little, which is that if we have this finite amount of matter, but it can be rearranged into a finite number of different arrangements. Nonetheless, this means that because there's such a stupendous number of different arrangements that we could have, that we would have all possible arrangements represented there somewhere or other. I don't know that that follows. I don't know that that follows. It falls out of the way in which the physics actually works. Unless of course you're talking about the Everettian quantum theory where yes, indeed, there will be versions of you, versions of you that are very similar to you and versions of you that are very different to you. But this idea of traveling physically through space to reach another planet,

### 31m

for example, where there's someone very similar to you there. I don't know that that follows. We would need another physical law that mandates that all the different possible arrangements really would be represented out there in deep dark areas of our universe, somewhere or another spatially connected regions to the one that we occupy here. I don't know that it follows that you're getting something like the Everettian multiverse here in our regular physical universe, just at a great distance from us, which is what he's talking about here. It could be, it very well could be that distant regions of the universe have subtly different physical properties to what is had here. Because of just quirks of the big bang, for example, quirks of the big bang could distribute the matter in different ways. And so I could clump together in different ways. And this would mean that not all clumpings are going to lead to the, what we see around us in our region.

### 32m

I model collapsed together into a black hole in some of these places. It might spread out into a vacuous nothingness. There's a, there's nothing that says that the kind of multiverse he's talking about here needs to represent all possible configurations of matter. That just, just might not happen unless there's a physical law that says, well, yes, this kind of thing happens, but I know of no such physical law that mandates this. This is in the realm of the, just the unknown, just the unknown. It's, it's, it's a form of metaphysics. As I say, it's a stepping outside of science. I don't know how we could test this exactly yet. Yet. Let's keep on going. It's a very mind boggling idea. We don't know for a fact that it's like this, but this is the sort of the vanilla flavored cosmological model. The one that, is the most popular today. Right, right. Well, and I think the weak link in this chain of reasoning here or the place where, where a skeptical person can get off this train is in the assumption or belief that inflation implies an infinite universe rather than just a very large one.

### 33m

And so if it seems like you could pull the brakes there, but unfortunately this concept of a multiverse judging from your discussion of it in your book, and this is, this is what I didn't understand before I picked up your book seems over determined. It seems that, there are other ways that arriving at this multiverse concept, which we'll get to. And so it's, it has a scientifically speaking, there are many reasons to believe in a functionally infinite number of copies of ourselves, living out lives of, for all intents and purposes, exactly similar or differing to every possible degree, right? So it's true to say that everything that can happen does happen under this rubric. That's right. So just to distinguish between what we know and what we don't know. For sure. The part that we don't know for sure is that space is infinite or that there's an infinite number of anything. And for, for people who feel really bothered by these implications and want to get rid of the infinity. In fact, I, I have a whole section in the book where I attack infinity and,

### 34m

and list all the ways in which you can get rid of the infinity. So there's a lot of interesting opportunities there and we're going to know more, I think in the next five or 10 years. However, what I think seems pretty much inescapable at this point is that there, um, the ultimate, the full reality is at least much larger than what we can see. There's just no way that space ends exactly at the edge of our universe. In fact, if you had made that claim, you know, one minute ago, I could falsify it now by looking with a telescope because I can see light that's traveled from one minute farther away. And that's pretty far. That's a sixth of the way to the sun and eighth of the way to the sun already. Right. And so we should probably get used to the idea that we live in a much grander reality than, than we thought we did. And I think that's a good thing. Yeah. Oh yeah. No, I, so I don't think people's intuitions recoil at the very, very large or even, I think people are prepared to embrace the infinite and the eternal in some sense, even though we could debate whether thinking about a beginning is actually more understandable than thinking about an eternal universe,

### 35m

given how squirrelly the beginning begins to look. But I think what, what really will blow the mind of, um, anyone who thinks about it, long enough and, and, and, and seems very difficult to accept is this idea at the level one multiverse, what is implied by the, just the sheer concept of infinity, that everything that is possible is in fact actual on some level, everything is true. And let's just spell out why this should be disturbing and why this may in fact be at least at first glance, a real embarrassment to science because science prides itself on being parsimonious. Well, no, it's not the case that the level one universe in any way, shape or form says that everything that's possible is true. I don't get that. That everything is true in some way. In fact, I think he said there's an ambiguity about what that would mean.

### 36m

Anyway, do we mean everything that's physically possible is true or everything that's logically possible is true. Well, it can't mean the last thing, which is the level four multiverse. So the level one multiverse, which is just, the space, even if space was infinite, even if space was infinite, that doesn't even imply that everything physically possible would be true. It doesn't imply that at all. I could readily imagine an infinite space where we occupy a region, which is different to the rest. You'd need to have a particular kind of what's called the cosmological principle, which says that there's nothing particularly special about our particular region of space. But we, if we don't have access to these other regions of space, these other infinite region of space, we could easily, postulate other regions of space, which are empathy. For example, you'd still have infinite space. We could have any infinite space beyond what we can see that is filled with nothing but hydrogen nuclei, which is protons. There'll be a basically a featureless universe. But the thing is, if we can't observe,

### 37m

and if we don't have good explanation of at this point, what this infinite space is like, then you're just postulating a particular metaphysics. Once again, saying that somewhere off in this universe, in this infinite space, there must be every single physically possible thing represented there in some way, shape or form. But I don't see that that follows. If all you're saying is it's an infinite space, even if you said it's an infinite space like ours, that doesn't mean that you're going to eventually get an earth just like ours here. You have to add extra assumptions to this idea. The extra assumptions being, well, you've got the same kind of distribution of matter out there in infinite space, but that's, a very specific assumption that you're making. And it's ruling out all the ways in which you don't have the same distribution of matter elsewhere. There's something very special about the earth after all. Just, I mean, just look around. It's unusual. The universe vast as it is, may only contain one earth,

### 38m

may only contain one earth. Of course, infinity tends to sort some of these things out for you, but the level one multiverse, I'm not so sure. No, I'm not so sure. And certainly it does not imply it certainly would not imply. Or logically possible realities out there somewhere that certainly doesn't follow. Okay. Sam and Max then go on to talk about parsimony. Okay. The, which is basically Occam's razor, this idea that all else being equal, we should choose the simplest explanation. Uh, this was why, when I asked professor Paul Davies, why didn't he endorse the multiverse, the Everettian multiverse? When I had the chance to talk to him about this, he appealed to Occam's razor. He said, well, in order to explain the one universe, we do, observe, we're invoking the existence of an infinite number that we can't observe. And at the time I bought it, of course, now I realize no Occam's razor is about the number of independent assumptions that you have. And you know, the multiverse, the Everettian multiverse has no real additional assumptions being added on to the formalism of quantum theory.

### 39m

It's just saying, well, take the equation seriously, take them, literally take the results of the experiment seriously. And this is all you get. You don't need to add anything about consciousness and the observer or anything else. Everything just a base. The same physical laws. And so therefore you have these, you have all matter obeying the same physical laws and the equations describe the existence of these other things. And it also explains why you won't observe these other things. You can't communicate between universes, for example. So, so they, they quite rightly point out that parsimony or, you know, recourse to the simplest theory, Occam's razor, whatever you, however you want to describe this is not a reason to object to multiverse theories in general. And certainly not a reason to object to the Everettian multiverse. But once again, they're, they're kind of dancing around the Everettian multiverse. I never get there and talk about quantum theory, which is a shame that the one, the one really interesting by virtue of the fact of being an explanation that is unusual, but also so far as we can tell,

### 40m

it's the correct one. It's the right one. So I'm going to skip through all of that because I think listeners to talk cast readers of the fabric of reality, for example, know about, uh, Occam's razor and parsimony, and that's this kind of thing. Let's press on into the multiverse to level two, except this will push people's intuitions in the direction of feeling like at the very least we're, we're trying to have our cake and eat it too on this question of, of parsimony. So, so take us to the level two multiverse and perhaps say why this is relevant to the question of fine tuning and, uh, at which and the question of fine tuning as many people will recall is relevant to this idea of that many religious people have of why religion, the idea of a creator God in particular makes sense given the apparent fine tuning of our universe, but pleasure. So the level two multiverse, you can again synonymously called simply space.

### 41m

If you want inflation is able to actually not only make an infinite space, but it's actually able to make, fit within this an infinite number of regions that each seem infinite to whoever lives inside of them through some, some very, very weird properties of Einstein's gravity theory that I talk about in the book. And what's interesting about this is that when you ask how diverse is space, you might think, oh, you know, in some places our podcasts goes like here and other places we talk about other things, but at least the laws of physics, are the same everywhere. You might think at least even if we learn people learn different things in history class, if the Sam Harris somewhere else learns different things in his history class because the quark started out differently there and history played out differently, at least he's going to learn the same thing in physics class. But the level two multiverse changes that also because it turned out that a lot of things that we thought were fundamental laws of physics that were true everywhere in space were actually not,

### 42m

it seems. And I like to, I like to think about it as if I were a fish swimming around in the ocean, I would think that it's a law of physics. The water is something you can swim through because that's the only kind of water I know. And it seems to be that way everywhere I look. But if I could solve the equations, discover the equations for water and I could solve them and see that there are actually three solutions, not one. There's the water solution and also ice and steam equivalently. There are a lot of hints now in physics that, what we call empty space is also like that, that it can freeze and melt and come in many different variants. And the thing is, inflation is so violent that if space actually can be in many different forms, what inflation will do is it will create each of those kinds of space and an infinite amount of it at that.

### 43m

So if you go really, really far away, you might find yourself in a, in a part of space where there are not actually six kinds of quirks. Like, there are here, but maybe there are 10 kinds of quirks. So the level two multiverse is very, very diverse. Also, a lot of things that we learn in school are fundamental parameters of physics. For example, that the number 1836 seems kind of hardwired into our world in that, that the proton is 1836 times heavier than an electron. Why is that? Well, string theory suggests that actually that's one of those things that also changes, depending on what kind of space you have. So it might be 2015 somewhere else in 666 somewhere else. And this explains this fine tuning problem that you mentioned because we've discovered, as I alluded to earlier, that there are these 32 numbers, pure numbers with no units or anything that we've measured that we can use to calculate everything else.

### 44m

And we wonder a lot about where they came from. So these are the constants of nature. Could you just list a few of them to give people a sense? Yeah. So 1836 is one of them. How much heavier a proton is than a neutron. You can transform them in different ways. Another one which is super talked about these days is that the density of dark energy. Okay. So as I explained in episode one of my discussion of their discussion, the level two multiverse is a version of the multiverse where it's presumed that the initial conditions are somewhat different. And indeed, the constants of nature are somewhat different. And this arises out of, as Max is explaining there, versions of string theory. Now we don't know. This is a kind of metaphysics as to whether or not such universes exist. But we're still within the realm of, although he insinuated there that the laws of physics are different, not really.

### 45m

We still have, although we might have different numbers of quarks in these other universes, we still have quarks. For example, we're still bounded by what string theory says is possible. So we're not yet in the realm of all logically possible universes. We're not there yet. But we are saying, well, you can vary the constants of nature, let's say, but we still have constants of nature. Those constants of nature still exist. And so perhaps we can explore the space of all different constants of nature. Now, this is actually done by some people. Some people, this is their job. Cosmologists. Luke Barnes, who is easily found on Twitter, is one of the people I follow on Twitter. He's a cosmologist at the University of Western Sydney. He works with Grant Lewis, who is an astrophysicist at the University of Sydney. They've written books on this. Well, they've written at least one book called A Fortunate Universe. Now, there have been many books written on this idea of fine tuning. Some people disagree with fine tuning. I buy it as being a problem. Why is it that we inhabit a region of space where the constants are what they are? We don't know yet. And as I've already explained,

### 46m

it could be, it could be that we have this multiverse of universes where all the different constants of nature are out there, represented somewhere, or other. Okay. That could be the case. And we, of course, occupy the one where the constants are just right. And there are many other universes kind of like this as well. Well, the work of Luke Barnes, among others, sort of suggests that this fine tuning is very, very fine tuned. And we need an explanation for this. Many people say we don't need an explanation for this. Now, Barnes, for one, thinks that it's a very poor explanation to say, well, it's the multiverse that explains this stuff. And I'll give a link in the information, information for this podcast and for this episode to his material on this. He does some wonderful lectures. He's also been on closer to truth, which is probably my favorite YouTube channel out there. He's been interviewed there. He's an Aussie. And so he has this to my mind, anyway, rather clear way of speaking about this stuff and no nonsense sort of way of speaking about this stuff.

### 47m

He's had debates with people like Sean Carroll, and he's had debates with people like Sabine Hossenfelder. So, you know, talking to some of the big names out there about all of this stuff. And he really knows his stuff. I mean, he is really across this. And he does things like simulates entire universes in supercomputers to see what happens when you alter these constants of nature just to see what happens. So it does seem like there's a problem there. Certainly one of the things that I was most interested in exploring when I was doing formal studies in astronomy and cosmology was looking into this issue of just how fine tuned the constants of nature are. Could you change them? Very much at all. And well, it turns out you can't change them very much at all. You're just the smallest changes to things like the value of the gravitational constant, the strength of gravity or the value of the mass of the proton. These kind of things either put changes in these kind of things either cause all matter in the universe to collapse into black holes. And so you don't get any stars.

### 48m

Therefore, you're not going to get any planets or cause a universe where the gravity isn't strong enough in order to collapse into black holes and so you don't get any stars. Therefore, you're not going to get any planets or cause a universe where the gravity isn't strong enough in order to collapse into black holes and so you don't get any stars. Therefore, you're not going to get any planets or cause a universe where the gravity isn't strong enough in order to collapse into black holes and so you don't get any stars. Therefore, any planets or cause a universe where the gravity isn't strong enough in order to collapse matter into stars at all in the first place and so all you're left with is clouds of hydrogen and helium gas so you'd have no life in such a universe there either so that's just a few of the constants now as for all the other constants well you can have changes in cosmological constants that cause a ripping apart of space-time very early on in the universe or even just after the big bang you get an immediate re-collapse into a big crunch kind of thing so this is a very interesting question open area of research we don't know much yet and so this is what they're talking about here with this kind of level two multiverse that maybe all the different constants of nature are out there being explored somewhere other but they're still bound by the basic laws of physics these universes are obeying different versions of string theory that's one thing so they're still obeying a certain kind of explanation unlike the level four one as i keep mentioning where you're having every single kind of physical orbit so forget string

### 49m

theory that's just one tiny sliver of all the possible physical laws that you could have which is what the level four one is but in either case do we know as in to say we have a good explanation of this as being an account of reality a reality that we inhabit so let me skip towards the end of their discussion on the multiverse if it's infinite just suggests that everything that happens that can happen within the laws of physics does happen with the level two we're talking about inflation creating an infinite number of bubble universes which wherein the laws of physics themselves vary in every conceivable way and we well let me just interject so it doesn't sound too weird instead of talking about bubble universes we can just keep saying space because there's still only one space but these are reason we can't but it's not it's not in a straightforward sense that that is no it is actually but the reason the reason we can never get

### 50m

to another part of the level two multiverse is because in order to go there you would have to go through a region of space which is still inflating and stretching out so like if you're if you have your kids in the back seat asking are we there yet you know you would say oh yeah we'll be there in uh one hour and a little bit later they ask are we there yet and you'll be like yeah we'll be there in two hours right right so so inflation can actually create this funny situation where you have many even infinite regions of space that are still fitting into one single piece of space so that's that's one clarification it's still just this one space but messy and and the second thing is it's not that the actual laws of physics are different it's just that things that we thought were laws of physics turned out to actually just be different solutions to the laws of physics exactly ice is not the different law of physics from liquid water or steam they turn out to be three different solutions to to the equations for water and and that's something occam would like because it makes physics itself

### 51m

simpler and it makes history more complicated that's a fascinating idea and it is one that closes the door to this otherwise embarrassing problem of fine tuning which is you know how did we how is it that we find ourselves in the universe that seems perfectly tuned to support life and intelligent life and beings exactly like ourselves in a position to wonder about these and other efforts to close that door just with the what's been called the the anthropic principle which you stated earlier just that the only place we can find ourselves is a place that's compatible with with our existence and so that shouldn't be surprising and yet it has seemed surprising that essentially that we should exist at all that the universe could have been an infinite number of ways and it just happened to be this way well in according to the level two multiverse the universe is essentially an infinite number of ways and there are an infinite number of universes that are not compatible with life it's kind of a it's a

### 52m

darwinian principle of universe emergence that the only places you can find yourself are the places you you can find yourself and every place that is possible in some sense exists yeah i i don't like the use of the term anthropic principle for these sort of things the word principle makes it sound like it's somehow optional i mean it's just correct use of logic which of course is not optional you know the it's like why i'll are you really really surprised that out of all the eight planets in our solar system we're living on earth rather than venus where it's 900 fahrenheit right now or on jupiter where there's no surface to stand on you're probably not very surprised i wouldn't call that some deep principle it's just common sense that the vast majority of our solar system is it's not very friendly for our kind of life and the vast majority of space is horrible for our kind of life and uh therefore we should not be surprised that we're living on earth rather than venus where it's it shouldn't be very surprised that we're living in a special very a very special part of the space

### 53m

that we can see yeah it is kind of that we're living in a special part of the space we can't see either so one way of closing the door to the the this mystery of fine tuning which doesn't entail yet another multiverse so a level two multiverse is this idea that we could be in a simulation i don't know if this argument originates with uh your friend nick bostrom or if other people have i know other people have arrived at this independently but the argument is older but nick bostrom made a very detailed argument for why we he thinks it's actually likely that we live in a simulation right so so and yeah so i guess we can open the door to that too so the his argument in brief is that if you imagine ourselves in the distant future or or beings like ourselves that make vast gains in their ability to produce computers and it stands to reason that they will simulate a simulation of a simulation of a simulation of a simulation of a simulation of a simulation on those computers assuming that such a thing is possible and there's really no reason to

### 54m

think it isn't and then by just dint of numbers you would expect simulations to vastly outnumber real universes and therefore you would expect that you should be in a simulation rather than in a real universe that argument sort of stands on its own unrelated to this issue of fine tuning or or a or the multiverse but if taken seriously the prospect of being a simulation of a simulation in a simulation it does answer this fine tuning argument as well so i always want to ask of the simulation hypothesis what problem does it solve i don't know that it solves this fine tuning is yet another one it's just an appeal to the supernatural uh but but if we do live in a simulation then that will be revealed to us eventually people might say oh how could it possibly well we would get to a point where a problem would arise that would require us to postulate something outside of the simulation a simulation won't necessarily have infinite

### 55m

complexity in fact nothing can have infinite complexity but reality itself now david deutsch argues this in the fabric of reality a simulation has to be running on a computer which presumably is in a genuine physical reality of some kind computing stuff obeying the laws of that universe but the computer that the simulation is running on will have finite memory finite processing speed and so we would get to a point where we'd be delving into subatomic particles what we think are subatomic particles and just get to the point where we realize or we resolve the individual bits and this would be telling this would be telling us to if we got to the end like that an end point like that then we would have to ask why and if there was no such answer we'd have to postulate that this reality exists in another reality namely a simulation type thing that is causing it to resolve into these fundamental things which can't be broken down any further i can't imagine what that would be like

### 56m

exactly but there would come a wall before us when it comes to progress and that would cry out for an explanation an explanation that couldn't be within the universe because the universe after all at that point would be bounded it would be this wall but we could then ask the question what's outside the universe because we'd get to the point where we'd be delving into subatomic particles and we'd get to the end of it in some way well i don't mean the end of it in space necessarily although that could be a possibility as well but the end in some way to us resolving stuff uh finding solutions now in particular the the smallest particles of matter there would be a smallest particle of matter or something the equivalent of that some some problem would just get solved and there would be no way of moving beyond that no way of making progress unless we postulate something smaller still but there wouldn't be a way of making progress unless there wouldn't be something smaller still it would be a strange reality to occupy so we would find out we would be able to find out we're in the simulation we would postulate the existence

### 57m

of something else on which this simulation is running and it doesn't solve anything anyway i mean because the simulation hypothesis still postulates a fundamental actual reality so saying we're in a simulation is just to say we're in a thing that's in physical reality or in a thing that's in a thing that's in physical reality it doesn't deny the existence of physical reality and the simulation hypothesis still postulates just more stuff in physical reality that's all and the physical reality is something different to what we think it is but it doesn't mean it's completely and utterly inaccessible why because we've got universal mind so we can always guess at what's outside and perhaps do tests and get sick find ways who knows the creative people of the future if we do live in a simulation would come up with ideas about how to test this kind of stuff anyway navel gazing i would say is this kind of thing it doesn't solve any problem of ours right now i've spoken about the simulation hypothesis before so i'm going to skip past what uh sam and max say on this point so well this might be a good bridge and now i'm mindful of of your time

### 58m

here uh so we're not doing anything like justice to the contents of your book uh we're going to skip over the other ways in which you can arrive at a conception of a multiverse in particular the multiverse of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the quantum mechanical issues addressed by hugh everett and um all of that is fascinating and it's just another route into infinite copies of ourselves having infinite versions of this podcast and no doubt in some of those podcasts we treat these these topics at much greater length but i think this is a good bridge to ai where which is where you and i met okay so there we go and i would say unfortunately unfortunately max doesn't get to explain the everettian view of the multiverse i'd like to hear how other people explain that particular good scientific explanation um yes so max's book is

### 59m

well worth getting on this point but like sean carroll i think that he mistakes the testability of the multiverse the everettian multiverse which david deutsch has of course written a paper on so here at the end i think it's a good point to make i think it's a good point to make it's important just to make some concluding summary remarks max tegmark is of course a great thinker a very good physicist highly accomplished and a clear writer of some fascinating topics however having read the mathematical universe and having heard a couple of interviews with him what i find is that there is a certainly a difference in epistemology let's just say that between a perspective that david deutsch presents in and a perspective that he presents in and a in the fabric of reality and the beginning of infinity and what you get in something like max's book our mathematical universe and i am going to read a little just a few short snippets from his book just to give you a taste of what i mean about this difference between epistemologies and

### 1h 0m

how it comes to affect something like the physics and the conclusions and importantly what i would say is the metaphysics the broader reality within which one's physics sits one's way of understanding just reality at the broadest possible scale i think this is why having a good understanding of some epistemology at least clarifies things because two misconceptions tend to creep in the one is as you would have heard when max speaks there and sam can tend to do this sometimes as well is that they make a dividing line between knowing and knowing for sure so he said that phrase at least twice that i recall in the recordings that i made of that discussion he would say it's something we don't yet know for sure but we can't know for sure yet he implies we can but how do we know for sure

### 1h 1m

we either know something or we don't know something and that's that we can just say of these multiverse theories yes we know that's the good explanation of what's going on or we don't know yet yet and i would say that for what he's calling level one absolutely we know it's part of our knowledge this is predictive it's explanatory it describes what's going on out there in the universe it is the universe it is just our explanation of space as we understand it and the level three multiverse yes we know it we know it as the explanation of what's happening in quantum theory so i agree with max possibly for different reasons but i agree with max for that reason although perhaps we also differ on things like whether or not we know once and for all we know for sure that these things are true i would just say we know them the the appending of for sure is a superfluous unnecessary in fact

### 1h 2m

it reduces the meaning of no to something that means it's a useless kind of a word because you never reach this for sure bar but max does conflate the two at times no and no for sure he wants to say it can't be known until it's known sure and it's the sure part that makes it known and sure means certain but how can we be certain the history of science is enough to give us fallibilism the the overturning of previous theories that people many people were certain of at the time and you also hear throughout the discussion max making quite a point about this unobserved stuff being a part of science and sam agreeing as well and of course i agree and david deutsch agrees that the unobserved is absolutely a part of science but popper continues to say that the unobserved is absolutely a part of science continues to be denigrated in some way as if popper's epistemology implies that the unobserved is not accounted for because it's not testable within his conception of reality which is completely wrong in fact popper is the only one who is able to explain how via david deutsch i

### 1h 3m

would say that we get to a knowledge of the unobserved through our theories via our observations when you're an empiricist which is a very important thing to understand is that the unobserved is so many people are they say that well knowledge is derived from what you observe and so you're stuck within what you observe it's but it is difficult to get a handle on exactly where max is coming from in constructing knowledge as such i can't find references to him describing himself as a bayesian and certainly he doesn't make a big deal of it in the indices of his books let's say you can't find the word bays or bayesianism there however you do find claims that he believes his theories he says as much this is completely unlike what popper implored us to do and what physicists like michael faraday thought michael faraday said something to the effect of i hold my theories on the tips of my fingers so the merest breath

### 1h 4m

of fact will blow them away so he understood testability he understood that you can have your theories all day long but once the observation comes along and it refutes your theory in light of a better theory well so much for having believed your theory there's no need to believe your theory scientists shouldn't believe their theories it's the wrong epistemology it's the wrong way of going about science science explains the world through misconceptions we say misconceptions because we should expect our theories to contain some error not to be the final word on things and because there's an error there they'll be fixed one day overturned and we'll look back and go well that was a misconception useful as it was to solve problems and getting something right about the world saying something correct something true containing truth an explanation but nonetheless ultimately in the final analysis false and misconception so why believe it why think it's true what does this

### 1h 5m

word belief mean in this sense what function does it serve once one begins believing things one ceases to be a fallibilist but then of course the times back says but we don't know for sure so it's hard to know exactly where he's coming from it's not there's not a consistency there in the book i've just released a podcast called lookouts and it's about worldviews and it says why having a worldview which in other words i would say not only a rich deep foundational understanding of the science but also having an understanding of what metaphysics is ontology and the science of science and the science of science and the science of biology epistemology and how these things relate to everything else science physics mathematics and and how all of this can come to bear on broader even more important things perhaps like

### 1h 6m

morality and having a conception of all of these things that is encompassed by a philosophy of how to make progress how to understand the world and that we don't get to final answers and the problem we're thinking that one can get to final answers rather than simply improve continuously over time and it's going to read an excerpt from page 880 from our mathematical universe this is chapter 12 it's a so it's a big tome all about the different levels of multiverse and he says this is max tegmark speaking quote interestingly in the context of the mathematical universe hypothesis the existence of the level four multiverse isn't optional as we discussed in detail in the previous chapter the mathematical universe hypothesis is not optional as we discussed in detail in the says that a mathematical structure is our external physical reality rather than being merely a description thereof this equivalence between physical and mathematical existence means that if a mathematical structure contains a self-aware substructure it will perceive itself

as existing in a physically real universe just as you and I do albeit generically a universe with different properties from ours Stephen Hawking famously asked what is it that we can learn from breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe. In the context of the mathematical universe hypothesis, there's no fire breathing required, since the point isn't that a mathematical structure describes a universe, but that it is a universe. Moreover, there's no making required either. You can't make a mathematical structure. It simply exists. It doesn't exist in space and time. Space and time may exist in it. In other words, all structures that exist mathematically have the same ontological status, and the most interesting question isn't which ones exist physically. They all do, end quote. So as I say, that's from chapter 12, and it's from

### 1h 8m

a section in chapter 12, the title of which is, and I'll read you the title, Why I Believe in the Level 4 Multiverse. So I think that that's just a departure from science, I'm afraid to say. It's somewhat a departure from rationality. He calls what he's doing the mathematical universe hypothesis, yet he says he believes it. Why? What is the rational reason? We're not given one. We're told that all mathematical structures just exist. Now, this is confusing necessary truth with our knowledge of the universe. We're not given one. We're told that all mathematical structures just exist. He's saying that he's gotten to the ultimate final truth, and that truth is that the entire universe consists of mathematics. In fact, there are an infinite number of universes out there that are made of mathematics. But what privileges mathematics? What makes the difference between the abstract

### 1h 9m

mathematical objects and the abstract any other objects? The difficulty for Max fundamentally is that he cannot get outside of his physical brain. Now, he argues in a circular way. He says that everything is mathematical. It's Pythagoras' idea. All is number. He begins with that assumption and then reaches that conclusion in the end as well, rather than starting with problems. For example, what is the brain? Figuring out, well, okay, the brain is made of neurons. What are neurons made of? They're made of atoms. Okay, that's a form of matter. What are the laws that matter must obey? Well, quantum laws of physics. Are the quantum laws of physics computable? Indeed, they are. Indeed, all physical structures undergo physical processes themselves which are computable, and that includes brains. That includes brains that do mathematics to come to an understanding of mathematics. However, what we also understand

### 1h 10m

via this process, via this understanding of computational universality, is that computers can introduce errors. They're not perfect machines. They can error correct, but there's no getting around the fact that it could be the case that a mistake is made at any point during the explanation, the computation, the calculation, however you want to put it. A neuron can misfire. An electron can go the wrong way. A person can just make a mistake, and that cannot be escaped from, and that includes any conclusion reached by that brain or mind, we should say, and that includes minds that come to an understanding of mathematics. That's a form of mathematics. We've come to the conclusion that, for example, everything is made of maths, that everything consists of mathematics, and therefore, level four multiverses exist, don't necessarily exist, must exist, but this has all been arrived at via a brain obeying the laws of physics, via something we know, we know, we know that, and so we know that it can't be the case that we can

### 1h 11m

simultaneously know, for sure, that the mathematics of the universe is made of maths. The mathematical universe exists, as in the mathematical multiverse that Max Tegmark says exists. So what I'm sad to say is he is ignoring known science. It's true for him to say it's a mathematical universe hypothesis, but it is irrational for him to say that therefore he believes it. A scientist shouldn't believe their own theories, even when they're known, when they are the best explanations. But in this case, we don't even have a known theory. It's not even a good explanation. It's just a good explanation. It's just a good explanation. It's just a good explanation. It's just one explanation among many, among many to solve certain problems. Those problems I've already mentioned are just things like the fine-tuning issue, the fine-tuning problem. But what Max wants, and this has been true across the eons, is a certain foundation that explains absolutely everything once and for all. It's a kind of religious notion, this idea

### 1h 12m

that, you know, God created everything and that, you know, the ultimate answers are held by God, and that's not true. It's a kind of religious notion, this idea that, you know, God created everything and that, you know, there's nothing beyond that. Well, the mathematical universe, especially the level four multiverse, is that structure. It is that thing. It serves that purpose. It answers all questions. Let's just go on a little further, and I'll just read from page 959 of his book. And he says, quote, the level four multiverse does not imply that all imaginable universes exist. We humans can imagine many things that are mathematically undefined, and hence don't correspond to mathematical structures, mathematicians publish papers with existence proofs that demonstrate the mathematical consistency of various mathematical structure descriptions precisely because to do this is difficult and not possible in all cases, end quote. Elsewhere, when Max writes on this, he does speak in terms of all conceivable things exist. If you can conceive it, then it exists.

### 1h 13m

But now he's saying that not all imaginable universes exist. Maybe what he means, or should say when he's speaking more carefully, is that all conceivable mathematical structure exists out there somewhere or other. But as I also pointed out during this podcast, in other universes with different laws of physics, if there are people in those universes with different laws of physics, then they are able to prove different things about different mathematical structures. And so their conclusions that they reach about this level four multiverse, if it exists, would be different to ours. So whatever he's saying about the level four multiverse here, by his own reckoning, different in other parts of the level four multiverse. So what do we say? Whose level four multiverse is it? Is it constrained by the mathematics that's known here or known there, or rather provable here or provable there? We can't say. It's not easy to know. I don't know if the question is well defined either. It's true to say that logic is logic is logic and mathematics

### 1h 14m

is mathematics is mathematics, regardless of where you are. But assertions about what mathematical structures exist based on what human brains can do, trying to reach conclusions about places where the physics is, places where the physics is so different that what can be understood by mathematics is literally, literally inexplicable to us because our brain simply is unable to grok stuff that brains presumably obeying completely different laws of physics are able to grok. Well, we're getting into the intractable area of metaphysics and fantasy. So it's a very talk about these things. And this is why it would be straight strange for me to hear someone say they believe this stuff. But his problem is and what he can't escape from is he's making claims about this level four multiverse in this sense, at least where he said, it doesn't imply that all imaginable universes exist. We humans can imagine many things that are mathematically undefined and

### 1h 15m

hence don't correspond to mathematical structures. So he's saying that if they're not mathematically defined here by us, presumably by our mathematicians, then they won't exist in the level four multiverse. But our capacity to imagine stuff is constrained by our brain that obeys these laws of physics here. If the laws of physics elsewhere are different in the level four multiverse, which by definition they will be, then there will be people there whose brains are operating on laws of physics that allow them to compute and hence to imagine structures that we can't imagine. So he's contradicting himself that this itself is not possible. And so he's saying that we can't imagine concepts based on arguments. There might pop up aiser. These, these are the kind of discussions people have when they've had too many beers or smoked too much weed. I think this is it's just it is metaphysics. It's not constrained by what we know, but if you

### 1h 16m

want to have this sort of discussion, it should it should at least begin in what we know and what we know. know at the moment are lords of physics to the extent that we know them our best explanations this is why explanations need to be at the center of our concern about rationally understanding the world and having rational discussions and writing popular science books now finally i'm just going to skip way back to earlier in the book earlier in our mathematical universe where he mentions popper once and as you can guess as we always say here whenever i pick up a popular science book whenever i listen to a podcast whenever i tune into a youtube explainer video and carl popper comes up it comes up in the same way and it comes up in such a way that it's a misconception it came up during their conversation let's see what max has to say in the book itself because it comes to bear on what he thinks about testability now he doesn't even think as i think many others have

### 1h 17m

said before i think sean carroll has said even though these guys ostensibly indisputably endorsed the multiverse the many worlds interpretation everettian quantum theory they don't they don't think it can be testable well tech tegmark goes max goes even further he doesn't think that it needs to be testable he doesn't think not only does he not think it is testable he doesn't think it needs to be testable or should be testable because he doesn't think multiverses in general need to be testable and he says this because he claims multiverses are not theories in the first place and popper he says he claims when talking about testability was only talking about the testability of theories not predictions and the multiverse he says is a prediction from a theory now that's very cute but it's completely wrong but let me just read from page 346 of his book and he says quote let's be more specific the influential austro-british philosopher carl popper

### 1h 18m

popularized that our widely accepted adage quote if it's not falsifiable then it's not scientific end quote and he goes on to say physics is all about testing mathematical theories against observation if a theory can't be tested even in principle then it's logically impossible to ever falsify it which by popper's definition means that it's unscientific it follows then that the only thing that can have any hope of being scientific is a theory which brings us to a very important point parallel universes are not a theory but a prediction of certain theories end quote well look it's true to say that the claim of anything like x exists is not falsifiable and max uses the existence of a banana to point this out also just after this he goes on to say quote parallel universes if they exist are things and things can't be scientific

### 1h 19m

so a parallel universe can't be scientific any more than a banana can end quote i don't know what that means anyone who claims bananas do not exist has a falsifiable claim so he's completely confused about that and he's confused because he does not understand the criterion and he doesn't understand the criterion because he hasn't read popper is my guess or if he has he's misread him i mean popper wrote whole books many of them explaining his stuff it's a whole thing it's not just quote if it's not falsifiable then it's not scientific end quote but you know as i say this is what passes for popperian epistemology in some places if someone says bananas don't exist pull out a banana and go there you go it's a banana you've falsified their claim or there are no bananas in this room pull out a banana

### 1h 20m

if they if they still deny it well then you're in the presence of an irrational person that's how falsification works the thing is one better way of understanding popper on this point about testability or falsifiability or theories and predictions or whatever is just to begin with the assumption what we're doing is conjecturing we're guessing at reality we're interpreting stuff and then on that basis theories and predictions are conjectures they're all conjectures it's all conjectural that can all be tested of course the predictions can be tested of course the predictions can be falsified gain said shown to be false shown to be refuted they're they're a way of interpreting a consequence of a particular theory david deutch actually describes and in my multiverse series i spend some time explaining the way in which he would set up an experiment a possible experiment to distinguish the multi so-called multiverse interpretation the multiverse theory as compared to collapse models right there the

### 1h 21m

standard copenhagen interpretation this idea that the wave function collapses or some such that there aren't multiple universes okay there there is such an explanation that can be done i don't want to go through it right now but it will involve an agi one day the the future existence of an agi able to perform an interference experiment in its own brain okay this this sort of thing could be done but also any test of quantum theory is a test of the multiverse because they are one and the same thing and that's that's what we should be saying if we're going to properly explain these things so even the defenders of multiverse theory are not doing them themselves a favor by claiming in some way shape or form these things aren't testable they are they are this is why popperian epistemology is important this is why having a coherent world view as i say is important by having an understanding of how the philosophy gives you a certain kind of epistemology and the epistemology tells you about the limits of

### 1h 22m

knowledge what can be known in the way in which it works certainty and uncertainty it tells you about mathematics and why mathematics is important and why mathematics is important and why mathematics is important although it's about necessary truth it doesn't allow you to access certainty and app and the absolute truth of anything it doesn't put hierarchies there in place between science and mathematics it also doesn't allow you to know the ultimate nature of reality and it also tells you why that's not even desirable because we want progress and we want optimism and this idea that there is an end point in some way shape or form to our understanding this ultimate nature of reality is a depressing thought it also means that you end up with a lot of things that you end up with dogmas and doctrines and the idea that the truth is manifest ends up leading to tyranny so we've got a connection there with morality and politics it's all encompassing this this is why we like to explain the world view that's in the beginning of infinity and the fabric of reality and elsewhere it it provides you with this we're not just saying it has all the answers but it has some sort of coherent framework which allows you not to make what i

### 1h 23m

regard as clangers of logically inconsistent claims and pseudo scientific religious metaphysical claims as well none of this is to say that overall this is what max is doing he's not i tell you the the overwhelming majority of the book is good but i think it's just undermined by not having a deeper understanding of philosophy and epistemology you can't do away with these things i don't think a philosopher should ignore physics the most important sorts of physics things like consequences of quantum theory i think that's just really important to do mathematicians shouldn't ignore it as well and i think that's just really important none of them should ignore epistemology anyone who's versed in epistemology should have some understanding of science it's not to say one needs to be an expert in all of these things it's just helpful it helps to make progress in any one of these areas if you're an expert in one of them by knowing a little bit of the rest it helps everyone just to know a little bit but that's

the multiverse according to max tegmark or the multiverses according to max tegmark next time we're going to be talking about minds and i'm going to pick it up where at the end of this conversation they talk a little bit about agi and then their next conversation that they have is entirely devoted to agi and they're basically in furious agreement about things and about the dangers the potential dangers of agi and just not really understanding that agi would be a mind like ours able to universally explain stuff like we can to be creative like we can instead of course they make that error of well it might just have different goals and it would disregard us it'll have worse morality all this sort of stuff so we'll leave that until next time and until then bye
