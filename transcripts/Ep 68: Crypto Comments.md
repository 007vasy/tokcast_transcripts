Welcome to TopCast. This is a very quick episode, just about something that's going on right now. And it's the volatility of cryptocurrency. And the reason I'm talking about this is because I see so much emotion out there. And of course, this happens in financial markets. It's a really curious thing about economics, broadly speaking, that in financial markets, there's a lot of emotion. And this is a really new, innovative part of the economy, cryptocurrency. Ever since crypto began, enthusiasts have said something like, well, fiat money is fake anyways. Well, what's fiat money for anyone who's brand new to this? Well, let's begin there. Government controlled currencies, the dollars and pounds that we're familiar with, have not always existed. They used to be based on something. They used to be based on the gold standard, which is to say your $100 represented $100 stored somewhere

### 1m

in the form of gold, usually. And if you wanted, you could trade your $100 cash for the equivalent amount of gold. That's called representative money. And it no longer exists around the world as far as I know. It was apparently the American President Richard Nixon who decided in 1971 to get a law passed that meant the US dollar no longer represented some quantity of gold. The gold had a certain value based on supply and demand. And the dollar was pegged to that. It was connected to the value of the gold. So the government couldn't arbitrarily, at least not easily, change the value of the gold. I guess it could itself buy up lots of gold, and that would cause the value of the gold to go up, which would cause the value of the dollar to go up. But it was hard for them to just manufacture more gold. They couldn't create gold out of thin air. The dollar was decoupled from the gold standard in 1971, and the other governments of the

### 2m

world followed suit. It meant that governments could just print more money, create more money out of thin air. Now, they could have, you know, with the representative currency, had just printed more money as well. But there would have been legal problems with this. After all, the law was that the dollar was worth a certain amount of gold. And so printing money in this way was much harder. So changing the law to a fiat currency, by fiat, you could just decide. Fiat means you can just decide arbitrarily. And so fiat currency means the government can just decide arbitrarily the worth of the dollar. Now, people don't care much about this, but they should. And with cryptocurrency, it's entering younger people. Younger people are more interested now in economics than I think they have been ever before. Lots of young people are getting enthusiastic about. Cryptocurrency. But still, the typical consumer or taxpayer in the economy doesn't, I think,

### 3m

pay much attention to something like the value of the dollar, unless they're traveling overseas or something like that. If the government prints more money, or is being said to print more money by economists, the average person doesn't seem to care. And the economists seem to like this idea. And one of the reasons they like it is because it's called modern monetary policy, which is another word for printing money. It's another word for social ism. I'll come to that. Why should any of this matter? Well, because it causes inflation. So if you're a person who's watching this and you know nothing about the financial system, nothing about how money is printed, the relationship between government and money, and what cryptocurrency is, then maybe this video is for you. It's a very baby understanding of things and what's going on right now as well. Let's just consider an example. And for many people watching who usually watch my videos, this is going to be teaching grandma to suck eggs. something teaching you something you already know but be that as it may let's go on let's say

### 4m

there's something out in the world there that's hard one something that's difficult let's to produce let's say like a banana okay it's not trivial to create a banana my banana here i might say is worth a dollar and at the moment it's worth a dollar precisely because that is what i am charging for the banana i might put it on ebay or something say buy my banana it's a dollar and it's worth a dollar precisely if someone's willing to pay a dollar for it and not otherwise if no one ever pays a dollar for my banana then it's not actually worth that it's it's worth nothing at all because eventually it it ends up like this and then it gets even worse than that and if i don't eat it well if i eat it then it has some value it has value to me but otherwise it just becomes rotten decays away into nothingness and that worth that value is gone from the universe but if i sell it if i'm able to put it onto ebay and i sell it for a dollar then it's worth a dollar let's say i've got lots and lots of bananas i'm a banana

### 5m

grower and i put my bananas onto ebay of course it's not this simple i go to a market whatever it's a shim it's a thought experiment i i take my bananas for a dollar and i put them onto ebay and i start selling them but they start to sell really quickly now i notice this i notice they're selling very very quickly so i raise the price i raise the price to five dollars per banana but suddenly but now five dollars that's too much of a price increase and because they're so much more expensive you get this people will stop buying my bananas there is a price point beyond which people will refuse to pay so if it's worth a dollar it's worth a dollar because that is what someone's willing to pay but maybe i am selling lots and lots of bananas really fast at a dollar so i decide well i don't want to run out of bananas i'm going to raise the price to just two dollars and i'm going to raise the price to five dollars and i'm going to raise the price to two dollars and okay the rate at which i sell bananas goes down because not everyone can now afford my two dollar bananas but i can get away with selling them for two dollars and i can sell

### 6m

lots and i can make a lot more money than before and importantly i can sell maybe the maximum amount before i run out and before any of them turn out like this what's that got to do with anything well let's say the government prints money what happens then well suddenly lots of people in particular the government itself will come back to that but let's say the government itself but if the government prints lots of money and they have lots of dollars the government agent whoever represents the government can come along to me with their two dollars and say i'm going to buy your bananas for two dollars and they can start buying up all the bananas and of course what do i do as someone selling bananas well i raise the price of my bananas because apparently the government who wants to buy my bananas has an unlimited supply of cash so i just raise it to five now the person from the government doesn't care why should i buy my bananas because i'm going to buy my bananas and i'm going to buy my bananas they care they can just keep on printing money they can print as much money as i can ask for now not only can they can they buy up all my bananas for whatever price whatever price that i ask for

### 7m

they can just print more money and they'll be able to give it to me not only for my bananas but for every public good they can just start buying it up and so the price of everything goes up which is really bad for everyone else right because they don't get this money that the government has printed but the government needs to buy stuff for whatever price they want to buy it for whatever reason for its own offices for its military for um paying back stuff to other governments that it's borrowed money from maybe it wants to send resources overseas you know in the case of australia we we sell our coal to china let's say so if we print the money and start buying all the coal and we can send it to china because maybe we've borrowed money from china for example the price of everything goes up and if the price of coal goes up by the way so does electricity this is how inflation works so therein lies the problem if the government prints money then it's a problem if the government prints money then it's a problem that causes the price of everything else to go up to whatever the government is willing to pay and those people who can't just print their own money are now forced out of the market

### 8m

no one can buy the bananas no one could buy the bananas except for the government person well you might think well you're the government you know you're looking after your people if you're a good socialist you might think to yourself well why doesn't the government just print money a heap of money and give it to the people okay give everyone a thousand dollars this has been happening recently around the world stimulus checks because of covid which by the way i think is quite moral because the government has stopped people from working and those people have hitherto been paying taxes so they deserve to get some of it back putting that aside if you're a socialist you might very well think to yourself well why doesn't the government just print enough money so that everyone's a billionaire everyone is a billionaire we'll just give everyone a billion dollars forget a thousand dollar stimulus check or ten thousand dollars give everyone a billion dollars and we'll give everyone a billion why not what is the limit what is the reasonable limit we can get but seriously why not why not make everyone a billionaire by printing money and you see this

### 9m

kind of sometimes people don't know where to draw the line with things like minimum wage they say minimum wage should be raised to fifteen dollars why not raise the 20 or 50 or 100 they say well the companies can't afford it ah the companies can't afford it correct the companies can't afford it but how do you know or the government know what the companies can afford companies typically make pretty low profits and those profits get reinvested back into the company to make better products as well as to pay the wages of their staff and to employ more people more people is the key thing you raise the minimum wage they'll employ less people because they only have a certain amount of money to pay their employees and that that quantity of money x is either going to be spread among a thousand employees at fifteen dollars an hour or it's going to be spread among eight hundred employees and that's going to be spread among a thousand employees at eighteen dollars an hour or whatever the math's worked out to be you get the idea they can't just arbitrarily start to employ more people at a higher wage businesses don't work like that

### 10m

now minimum wage is kind of like this idea of printing money the universal basic income is kind of like this idea of printing money you're just giving people more money when there's not more money to give because the money has to represent something unless you're the government and you've got a fiat currency and you can just print money and you can print money and you can print as much money as you like so i'm just going to put aside the issue of minimum wage and universal basic income it's related but it's not the same when you just give people money especially newly printed money such that everyone is way more wealthy and for argument's sake we're thinking everyone gets a billion dollars in cash by the government what happens to my bananas well the price just goes up again just the same as the argument as before because everyone's got a billion dollars now i'm not going to charge a dollar for this i'm going to raise it a hundred dollars people will still have to pay the minimum wage and the universal basic income is related but it's not the same still pay a hundred dollars won't they because a hundred dollars to them now is nothing it's like it's what a dollar was before no it's it's much much different to that actually they probably pay

### 11m

a thousand or even ten thousand dollars for my banana it almost doesn't matter because there'll be someone there to meet the asking price and that's just for bananas of course you repeat this for luxury cars and computers you know um rolls royce cars you know if everyone became a billionaire in australia the price of a rolls royce here in australia would skyrocket to well over a billion dollars because someone would be willing to pay it someone would have the amount of cash to pay it in other words your one billion dollars you might be a billionaire doesn't pay for anything anymore it buys way less than what a billion dollars did a week ago before the government printed all this money that's called inflation the price of things going up because there's too much money out there now i mention this all for a reason fiat currency of the kind that we have allows government to very much control the price of things in this way a central authority in in essence is controlling

### 12m

the price and to some extent the supply and demand because they can print money for themselves and not for others or they can even print it for others as well either way it changes the price of stuff they've got their hand on the lever of supply and demand and therefore price of things controls which is precisely what happens in communist regimes and this is what makes cryptocurrency so attractive to many of us it's decentralized it's anti-authority it's at a distance from the government it allows individuals to then exchange goods and services between each other without the middleman anymore without worrying about what the price of commodities is that the government is trying to set the price of bananas is just deal with someone else without worrying about what the government thinks the value of something is the government is that middleman especially when they're printing money and they print money in an unethical way for unethical reasons namely to pay for things today they

### 13m

cannot afford right now and you might think well that's what i do with a loan except that the government is not the entity with the money its population is so they're borrowing on behalf of people who don't want to take the loan out the money that they have comes from the government from taxation worse than that if they borrow money today typically they're not even expecting taxpayers of today to pay the money back but taxpayers of tomorrow or the next generation rather because the debt is carried through for decades sometimes there's no guarantee the economies continue to grow of course this is the hope and this is the expectation it's the expectation even of someone with my worldview that thinks that progress causes growth and that's what i'm trying to say is that there's no guarantee that progress causes knowledge creation which causes economic growth but not invariably and not with bad economic decisions there's no guarantee this happens this happens given certain conditions like capitalism namely the opposite of what is

### 14m

going on with modern monetary policy with the printing of money so the fact that governments can buy fiat one might say print more money to pay their own bills especially to their own people is absurd and perverse this modern monetary policy is absolutely socialism by another name crypto is a way out of this cryptocurrency is a way out of this not only is is cryptocurrency it's impossible to just arbitrarily print more cryptocurrency it just does not work it's not only not allowed it's not physically possible but even if it were at least it's not the government doing it and and the other thing about crypto is it's it's no one else's business which is a wonderful thing about it like it's not the business of the government if jane and joe decide to exchange crypto for bananas it's no one else's business everyone else can keep their noses out of it unless someone's being coerced or having force used against them it's not anyone's business if jane and joe are

### 15m

engaged in a transaction even today under normal circumstances but even more so with crypto yes and this is just brings me to today people being upset about the volatility of crypto because yes it's not the business of the government it's the business of the government there are liabilities with cryptocurrencies there is the volatility and perhaps there will be for some time even if the trend has been broadly upwards there's no guarantee it will continue to rise but nor with fiat currency either there's absolutely no guarantee that inflation won't happen because the government is not guaranteed not to print money indeed apparently they're just going to continue to print money so inflation is a real risk at the moment there are liabilities with either currency it's just at least with crypto you don't have government control and the ability to just start printing stuff and moreover all we need all is that is needed for crypto to continue to succeed despite the volatility that has hitherto been happening especially over the last

### 16m

month in particular it's just a constant population or an increasing growing population of people to be involved in crypto buying bitcoin buying ether buying the various other cryptocurrencies but that's true for a nation as a whole you need a constantly growing or at least stable population if the population starts to decrease then you encounter some problems but as i say there are liabilities there are some liabilities with crypto but it's no worse than fiat currencies indeed it's better than those existing alternatives the government is there to resolve conflicts when people otherwise engage in the use of force that's the ideal form of government having government control the economy finance printing of money is abhorrent and it's causing all sorts of economic problems government need not be involved in

### 17m

currency because the currency is about it's but it's little more than the barter system i have a banana you have a pen you want the banana i want the pen we're swapping but but instead of like meeting us we're swapping the pen we're swapping the pen we're swapping the pen we're swapping the up and you know um me carrying bananas around and you carrying around pens we have this thing called money which is far more convenient and you know we've been carrying around cash for a long time we've been using banks to keep the money and that kind of thing and governments are getting involved as well they never needed to be involved they never needed to be involved in the first place so crypto takes them out of it and why not what is government competent in doing simultaneous with this issue of crypto and me talking about it is the u.s government this has been funny to me the u.s government talking about parts of the u.s government talking about parts of the u.s military talking about the fact they have footage evidence of alien craft or ufos you know the cagey about it ufos and i'm just with neil degrasse tyson on

### 18m

this you know it's it's called an unidentified flying object unidentified you don't know if it's a flying object who knows what it is my own favorite theory is well it's just the u.s military they're experimenting on their own military why wouldn't you this is done all the time it's always been done historically this is what militaries do there is part of the military that tests out other parts of military i know what happens here in australia our special forces for example try to break through our borders to test out something called our border force which isn't quite military it's quasi-military you know they're the border guards and if the special forces if our sas the special air service can get into the country dressed as illegal immigrants they know they've found a weakness in border protection now this sort of thing happens you know so why wouldn't there be a top secret part of the u.s military why wouldn't there be a top secret part of the u.s military testing to see whether vast naval ships and fighter pilots can

### 19m

be tricked into thinking that there's something there when there's nothing there could that happen and wouldn't that be useful you know if they're invaded by the chinese one day the chinese armada force if they can flick a switch and suddenly all those pilots are seeing tick-tacks wouldn't that be great it's very distracting that means that the u.s military now has an advantage because they can distract pilots and why wouldn't you do it to your own pilots first just to check out what their response is and then you don't tell anyone about it in fact you so much don't tell anyone about it that your own military is absolutely convinced they've encountered ufos over the last few years and they're willing to tell congress about it and they're willing to go public about it because they can't explain it meanwhile the top secret parts of i don't know what the pentagon is just not saying anything or as various other people have said we just don't know the point is the point is the government is made up of people and a lot of these people are incompetent who

### 20m

don't know anything whether it's about currencies and finance or about ufos and military stuff even if they're in the military they won't know everything the military of the usa is absolutely and nobody knows it and the military of the usa is absolutely powerful and if they don't know everything the military of the usa is absolutely powerful the military of the usa is absolutely powerful but that is not what has been done we are living in an era where the u.s military is so plentiful i think that the u.s military should go out and play football and go to the russians and go to the social networks ofั่ we have to do business on our own it has to be done and they have to do it it's a very important thing so we all can do this and we are the men we are the women who are the men who are the men we are the women who are the women who are hard to see. It's a bit revealing. Okay, so anyway, that's that. My main reason for making this video today is just to observe that there is volatility in the crypto market right now. The price is fluctuating a lot. People are variously concerned or bemused or elated. The trend in the long term

### 21m

is nevertheless an ongoing rise. Can we guarantee it will continue? Not at all. But the underlying explanation for why people want into this is coupled to the same groups, the people who are interested in crypto, the same groups, aversion, skepticism of government interventions into stuff. And those feelings won't be going anywhere. Yeah, there's a whole other group of people, the socialists and so on, the people who love the government, who love the state, who want the state to have as much or even more power than they do right now. They want the state to do lots of things for them, employ them, cure them, and so on. And so on. And so on. And so on. And so on. And so on. And so on. And so on. Cure them, treat them, house them, give them money. They want a paternalistic state. And there are others who reject all that. And moreover, want to extricate themselves from part of the government, maybe not all of the government, but parts of the government to try and get away from this control, as they see it, of the state on the individual. And those people

### 22m

are increasing in number, which means that the number of people just in general is increasing, of course. So both groups are increasing. But these people that are interested in crypto, who have this skepticism of government and fiat currency and what the government does with money is only going to increase. And the number of places where crypto is going to be useful and used and accepted are only going to increase as well. Look, it used to be the government controlled information. And in some places, still controls information, North Korea and China and so on. Some of the parts of the West, governments are trying to control information too. And so-called big tech is trying to do that. But most people realize, in the West at least, that the internet now is such that knowledge of individuals out there who use the internet is such that any attempt by a Western government to control the flow of information is pointless. It's a pointless exercise. The tech heads and smart people

### 23m

are in the main, not inside the governments. So it's not a fair fight at all. The smart people, the tech savvy people are outside the governments. The Western governments cannot control the flow of information. Indeed, in many places like the USA, there are laws and institutions in place already that prevent the government from intervening much into this area. Currency is just another kind of information. Cryptocurrency is another kind of information. And so any attempt to control this or to fiddle with the knobs, and I think like Elon Musk, first he said he loved Bitcoin, so the price went up. And then he said he was out of Bitcoin and he wasn't allowing people to pay for Tesla's Bitcoin. And so it went down again. This is one of the liabilities of cryptocurrencies for the moment. But they're a new technology and eventually things will stabilize. But I don't think they're going away. And I wouldn't be concerned about the fact that for the moment there is fluctuations in the market because it's a virtuous market like other markets as well. It's providing value and it's providing a means

### 24m

whereby individuals can control to some extent their interactions with each other without having a third party, specifically the government. Getting involved. Because those people in the government don't know what they're doing. They're not expert in much at all except government stuff. And that's not finance. That's not information. That's not science. That's a whole bunch of things that they're not expert in. So don't be concerned about volatility. This too shall pass.
