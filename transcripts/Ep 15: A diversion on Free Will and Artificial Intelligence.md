Hello everyone. This is a purely audio podcast today, and hopefully the audio quality is good. What I'm learning very quickly is that the audio takes only about a quarter of the time to produce as compared to the audio and the video together. I'm not sure exactly how much the video adds, to be honest. With episodes involving, say, mathematics, then sometimes I think the visual element can help, but more generally, I don't know. It's something I'm figuring out. But for now, for this episode, as you will have noticed from the title, it's about free will. I've gone through phases as most anyone interested in philosophy will have with free will. I started off thinking it was real, and then I was convinced for a time that I was wrong about that, and I changed my mind. Back to what I think now, which is that it is indeed a real thing. For a long time I was a proponent of the idea, which is pretty much mainstream now. The idea that determinism rules out free will. But now I think I understand reductionism

### 1m

better. So most scientists, let's take Sam Harris, who wrote a wonderful book on the topic. They argue that we do not have free will because we cannot possibly be aware of all the things that come to bear on affecting our conscious decisions. We did not choose our choices, or what choices are before us. I think that line of argument is a red herring. The crucial point is, do we choose our choices? If we do not choose, then what does? If it's not us, there must be something else doing the choosing. Now, I think the self is real, of course. I think we are universal explainers. Sam denies the actuality of the self, that on introspection the self disappears. Now, I think that the idea that when you are in a contemplative state, that when you turn your focus of attention onto yourself, the claim that the self then disappears is a real illusion. I think that itself is the illusion. Yes, of course, when one quietens their mind

### 2m

and tries to observe one's own subjectivity, one finds nothing. But this is just to say that when the mind isn't working, one cannot observe the mind thinking. There's no great mystery here. I think that when we're looking at our own subjectivity and finding that we cannot find ourself, it's rather like the claim that when you look at the stars at night, you do not see. So, merely not being able to observe something is no refutation of its existence. Just as almost everything of interest in science is very difficult to observe. If you merely look at your hand, you cannot, via observation alone, tell that it's made of atoms, and that those atoms are made up of smaller particles still. Observation alone doesn't get you there. It's not the case in science. It's not the

### 3m

case in third person science. So why it should be the case in a first person science of subjectivity, I don't know. But I'm not willing to change the rules. I think that in order to try and understand what the self is, and what free will is, we don't merely observe. We need to explain, and some observations will become crucial in distinguishing between different ideas about what's real and what's not. I think that in order to try and understand what the self is, and what free will is, So for me, it's no great mystery for me to say that consciousness on the one hand, and the contents of consciousness on the other, are quite different things. Indeed, they are. And what are we? Well, we, as universal explainers, when we find we're not explaining anything, there's not much going on in consciousness. But when we try explaining things, which is to say when we're thinking, there are special kinds of content in our consciousness. I do think we have responsibility for direction. Directing the contents of our consciousness. We cannot take full responsibility. We can't take

### 4m

full responsibility for anything. But we can take some responsibility. And that amount that we can take responsibility for, that's where free will becomes salient. But let me now turn to some other remarks about free will to try and convince you, if you don't agree that free will exists, that those who do deny its existence have indeed missed something crucial. Now, to make this case, I'm going to borrow an argument from David Deutsch in The Fabric of Reality. And it's about the reality of emergent phenomena and their causal effects in the real world. Now, the reason I'm borrowing this argument from The Fabric of Reality is in order to respond to what I think is the prevailing view in physics and neuroscience about the absence of free will. Sam Harris wrote a book called Free Will, and I think it's the best short account of this position. So the argument goes this way. Again, full credit to The Fabric of Reality and David Deutsch for this argument. So there is a statue sitting in Parliament Square in London. It's of the British Prime

### 5m

Minister during World War II, Winston Churchill. That statue is made of bronze. And at the tip of the nose of that statue is an atom of copper. Now, let's ask the question, why is that copper atom there? Here's one reason. Because the copper atom next to it bumped it some decades ago, and it bumped it because the copper atom next to that atom bumped it. All in accordance with the laws of physics. Indeed, that copper atom is there because, at the beginning of the universe, atoms were created, collided and moved around in just such a way that today, the copper atom of interest at the tip of Winston Churchill's nose is where it is. This is to say, the copper atom was determined to be there, following the initial conditions at the Big Bang and the laws of physics that exist in our universe. So now, returning to our question. Why did we create the Big Bang, and why is it there? why is that copper atom there? Do you understand why it's there? Well, in a sense you do, but it's

### 6m

a very strange form of understanding. And that vacuous argument about initial conditions in the Big Bang could be used to explain why anything, anywhere, anytime happens. But here's another story which explains why it's there. World War II was a huge historical event, where a bunch of terrible people in Germany, with terrible ideas, led by a dictator called Hitler, attempted to take away many human rights and freedoms we enjoy today from people all across Europe, especially the Jewish people. One of the great leaders of the Allies who fought against the Germans and Hitler was Winston Churchill. He led British forces to victory over Hitler, and it is customary in our culture to create statues of great leaders out of bronze and put them in public places. Bronze contains copper, and so that's why it's there. And so that's why it's there. And so that's why the statue is there. And therefore why the atom at the end of the statue's nose is a copper one.

### 7m

Now, which of these accounts actually explains why? In the first account, which could in fact be used every time for any process whatsoever, for example, why copper atoms are in coins, or why copper atoms are in your bloodstream, or indeed why a tree grows as it does, or a star explodes, or indeed why a person chooses to become a doctor and not an engineer, that first account, the deterministic account, the account that says what's going on in the universe is simply atoms in the void obeying physical laws, can always be applied to any event in physical reality. However, in the second case, when we provide an answer to the why question, we use words like statue and history and culture and speak about dictators and their actions. Are these things less real than atoms? I'll submit to you that they're not. No, they're not. They are patterns of atoms or even abstract things, but they are important in the causal chain of events, even though they are not mentioned by laws of particle physics or even

### 8m

form a part of the contents of chemistry. Indeed, to remove these higher order emergent things from our account is to create a less accurate, less complete explanation of why the atom is where it is. Emergent complexity, that is to say stuff that is more complex than an atom, but still very much real, like a statue or a person, really is important for our account. So let's now consider free will. Now, David uses that argument in the fabric of reality, not specifically to talk about free will. He's talking about emergence more broadly. But I want to apply this very argument to free will. Why is it that we choose one thing rather than another? One account is this. The electron or potassium ion or whatever goes left rather than right down some ion channel in a neuron and the neuron fires. And that neuron might not have fired if the electron or ion had not gone down that channel. And so therefore, we end up choosing one thing rather

### 9m

than another. We choose tea rather than coffee. That argument can always be made, no matter what. And it provides a purely predictive account of what is happening. It's completely vacuous. And though it might be intractable, in principle, it could provide the full chain of events from the movement of electrons to the movement of electrons. And so therefore, we end up choosing electrons to the movement of a teacup in the hand of a person. But at no point would we ever answer the question, why tea and not coffee? Except by recourse to, well, that's just what the laws of physics or neuroscience say. That's just where the potassium ion happened to go down the channel and therefore the neuron fired. And that's why the person chose coffee rather than tea. But it doesn't give us any indication of the true underlying reasons which would have to be based upon their motivations. For example, here's the following account of why I might choose tea rather than coffee. The account goes like this. I generally prefer tea. There are times when I have

### 10m

coffee, but I might have already had two coffees today. I'm not a person who likes to drink too much caffeine. And I tend to think for a moment pretty carefully about whether I want the anxiety and the jitteriness that comes with having a full three coffees in one morning. So I choose to have tea. I deliberate and choose. And this process has a name. I choose what I do because I am free to do so and deliberate and come to a conclusion. And we call this process the exercise of free will. It's an emergent phenomena. It's rather like culture. When we go to explain why the copper atom is at the tip of Winston Churchill's nose, the tip of the statue of Winston Churchill, we rely upon a historical story, an account in terms of these abstract ideas. It doesn't violate the idea that physics indeed determined why it is that the copper atom ended up at the tip of the nose of the statue of Winston Churchill, where it did. It is completely

### 11m

compatible with the idea that there was also this thing called World War II. So in the case of me choosing tea rather than coffee, I'm not discounting the fact that everything was determined, just as it was with the copper atoms. We cannot get away from the laws of physics. They apply to everything all the time. That's what universal means. They govern, for example, the behavior of nuclear blasts, but they cannot explain why it is that Hiroshima, and not Nagasaki, was bombed first at the end of World War II. It is poorly understood that determinism can actually work top down. The copper atom is there because people put it there, and they put it there because they made the statue out of bronze, and they did that to commemorate Winston Churchill. This high-level stuff about statues and history and people determined where the atom went, and not vice versa. Neuroscientists and physicists seem particularly poorly placed to appreciate this. Now, I'm not a physicist, but I have a degree in physics, and I know that they are very much fixated on bottom-up

### 12m

causation, and emergence is typically not a well-understood phenomena, not by many physicists. We can't even do the turbulent flow of fluids. So forget about trying to explain anything at a higher order of complexity for now. And so, with a choice about tea or coffee, the ions travelled down this channel, and not that one, and this neuron fired, and not that one, because I deliberated about coffee versus tea, and considering stuff important to me, made the free choice. And that is why the neurons that fired did, and that is why the particles went where they did, inside of my brain. If someone genuinely asks me, why tea, why not coffee? To answer with, well, a set of neurons fired in my head and forced me to choose tea and not coffee, would be a ridiculous answer. The real answer is, because I wanted tea. Because I've already had two cups of coffee today. And I could give even more reasons. And all of those reasons are an account of me exercising my free

### 13m

will. I am part of the causal chain. I made real choices. No one else is making the choice. Nothing else is making the choice. I am. This is pretty uncontroversial. And even Sam Harris agrees that choices are real. He just wants to deny that we have the free will to make them. But because I think this entire sequence of what's going on, the fact that I'm the one making the choices, the choices exist, it's me, as part of the causal chain, that is doing X rather than Y, I just think it's very convenient to give all of this a straightforward name, free will. The exercise of free, free meaning no one is coercing me, no one is forcing me, will, by which I mean my personal preferences. I'm exercising my free will. I'm exercising a non-coercive way of enacting my personal preferences. What am I? A person. What's a person? A person's a mind. An abstract thing. A set of ideas. But more than this, a person is also a

### 14m

kind of process for producing new ideas. We use the term universal explainer, which is the solution to the what is a person question found by David Deutsch and articulated in the beginning of Infinity. And of course, I refer everyone to that book. Simply look up person perhaps in the index. Anyways, whatever the case, abstract things we must recognize can have physical causes in the world. We've seen that through my podcast series when I refer to the reality of abstractions following David's chapter in the beginning of Infinity all about that. And I think that's one of the fundamental misconceptions that people who deny the reality of free will are missing. They're not only denying simply free will, they're denying the whole class of abstract reality to a large extent. I think that physical things can only cause other physical things, but they're wrong about that. Abstract things can have physical effects in the world. Abstract things can have physical effects

### 15m

in the world. It's worth repeating. There are all sorts of ways in which this happens. Culture is an abstract thing. It has physical effects in the world. People are abstract things. They have physical effects in the world. Our mind, our ideas, ideas very much so, are abstract things that have physical effects in the world. Indeed, knows this as well as anyone because he thinks that belief, a form of idea, is a lever which causes behavior, and behavior is a physical thing. So he understands that ideas can have physical effects in the world. Well, all we're saying here with free will is that there's an abstract thing, namely a kind of creative software, which is the mind running on the human brain that we refer to as the universal explainer, that has physical effects in the world. And the universal explainer is the mind running on the human brain. And the universal explainer is the being a creative thing, being a genuinely creative thing, does things that are unpredictable, unpredictable, inherently unpredictable. Why inherently unpredictable? Because that's what

### 16m

creativity is. Creativity, to be genuine, cannot be predicted beforehand. The contents of whatever your ideas are going to be cannot be predicted beforehand if you are a genuine universal explainer. Because a law of epistemology, if you like, is that we cannot predict the contents, of any theory's successor. And just about every idea you have constitutes some kind of theory about what to do next. Okay, so returning to our statue, just consider how the abstract idea, purely an abstract idea, that Hitler is evil and needs to be stopped. Well, it had the very real effect of bombs being dropped by the Allies under instruction from Churchill onto Berlin. All those abstract things cause real world physical effects. And so it is with free will. It's an abstract idea. And this idea that you are free to choose means you will choose one thing over another. We don't need to talk about atoms and ions,

### 17m

nerves or neurons, or even brains at all. Just abstract minds. And the idea that you are free to choose. That's all that free will ever needs to mean. Now let me also grapple at this moment with the strongest form of the deterministic argument that I've heard. Because until I get to the bottom of this, I'm not going to be able to answer that. Until I reached university, I never thought about the question of free will much. But had I been asked, I would have responded with the naive conception of free will that most people have. That they are the author of their thoughts. Now pressed, most people I think might well respond that they are the ultimate author of their thoughts and behaviour. This naive conception has a name. It's called libertarian free will. It somehow posits that a person has some ultimate, which is to say outside the normal chain of events, causal power over what their next choice will be. But of course, this is an appeal to the supernatural. They cannot be causes that are outside of what the laws of physics mandate. Which is to say, what happens,

### 18m

happens according to the laws of physics. So that's that. When I went to university for reasons that had nothing whatever to do with university, my best friend, still my best friend, hello Scott, convinced me that free will must be ruled out by determinism and also indeterminism. Whatever form the laws of physics were, they were what compelled signals in the brain to be what they were. It would not matter if the laws mandated determinism, in which case what you were about to do next was fixed by the initial conditions of the universe and the laws of physics, or if they permitted indeterminism, in which case what you did next was, again, not controlled by you, but rather something akin to the role of a truly fair dice. There seem to be only two possibilities. If you did not want to endorse some other kind of supernatural explanation either, what you did was determined prior events in your brain of which you were unaware, so the electron takes this path rather than that path in the brain and you choose x rather than y because of that, or what you did was not

### 19m

determined, in which case was random, and so therefore you also didn't choose it. If you think there is some third thing, like that you author your thoughts and nothing determines them, then you have to ask why those thoughts and not some other. There must be some reason why you think what you think. If not, then you are back to square one with no reason determines what you do, it's randomness determines what happens next. If there is no reason what you choose to do is what you choose to do, then you might as well be inclined to sing karaoke during the next funeral you attend as much as meditate in respectful silence. There are clearly reasons why we do what we do. It took me a long time to get past this sticking point. It's a sticking point Sam Harris and I think anyone else who thinks that determinism rules out free will is stuck at. Now, Sam also adds that subjectively, there is no feeling of free will. Now, I will simply have to differ with him there. Yes, indeed, I agree. Thoughts seem to arise unbidden, as if from the void into our minds. We, as the

### 20m

conscious subject of our experience, do not alter those thoughts. But this is an exceedingly narrow conception of what a person is. I do not think it is all clear, even when divesting yourself of your own personhood during a reflective moment, that this is all there is to being a person. Indeed, the sense of self that is lost during those moments of epiphany is just that. The loss of personhood, not a glimpse into the true nature of self. Why is that feeling that Sam and I, and so many others have in those moments, able to provide some guarantee of ultimate truth into the ontological reality of what the actual nature of self is? I think such a feeling is no more reliable than third-person objective arguments. Indeed, less so. And in this case, rarely, I'm with Wittgenstein. Whereof one cannot see the truth. Whereof one cannot see the truth. Whereof one cannot see the truth. Whereof one cannot speak. Thereof we must remain silent. The subjective experience of what it is to feel thoughts arise and pass away, and to allow the thought that I am a self dissolve away,

### 21m

so that pure consciousness remains, is not very instructive of what it means when carefully contemplating what to do next, when other axons are firing, so to speak. Sure, when attempting as hard as possible, by quietening the mind as much as possible, not to judge, reflect, or decide, you are, as hard as possible, not trying to be moved by your free will. It should be no surprise, then, that when you choose, notice the irony, not to use your free will, you will find, subjectively, that you don't have any. I'll say that again. If you're trying not to use your free will, by meditating and looking inwards, then choosing not to use your free will, and trying to observe that you have it, seems to be a strict contradiction. Of course you won't feel like you subjectively have free will, if you're deliberately, trying not to find it. When the next thought arises in your mind, for reasons I subjectively cannot account for, this does not change the fact that these are my thoughts. And were I a different

### 22m

person, some other thoughts would arise. I really do have a sense of free will. I genuinely do. Clearly, I cannot perform or entertain simultaneously two mutually incompatible thoughts. I think of X, and then I cannot think not X. I can decide between them by forming explanations about which is best. Indeed, sometimes I can toss a question, and then I can answer it. But this particular situation is a rare exception. I like to consider myself a reasonably thoughtful person, and so I tend to reflect and think upon the knowledge I have, and the deeper values I possess, about what course I would prefer to take. As Dan Dennett and so many others point out, this is when I have maximal degrees of freedom. If someone has a gun to my head and demands I choose X, not Y, then this has reduced my choice. But not the feeling I have for preferring X over Y. This is what freedom is. The will is. My will is unconstrained. How could it be? By the laws of physics? No. It is the laws of physics that permit the freedom of my will. Why should it be the case that just because the laws

### 23m

of physics determine everything, that this means they determine that freedom is impossible? It's quite the opposite. If you think there is a logical contradiction between determined to be the case and able to be free, then you misunderstand what free, determined, or perhaps both could mean. Consider. It has been determined that you are now the winner of a $60 million lottery. Or, it has been determined that you will now spend the remainder of your life in a small jail cell. Now, in both of those cases, we've got something's being determined. But they're very different states of the world, one in which you've won a large sum of money, and the other in which you've been determined to be sent to jail. So, the set of facts that has been determined by some other prior set of facts have very different degrees of freedom permitted under the rules that determine the two outcomes. Unless you think freedom is not logical, logically possible, then you have to think that there is some possible world in which freedom obtains. But if you think that the laws of the universe, no matter their form, necessarily rule

### 24m

out freedom, then you cannot be moved by arguments of this sort. You are trapped, so to speak, by a prison you have built for your own mind, and you're not doing much more really than saying freedom of the will is a logical contradiction. You're arguing that it's not possible under deterministic laws. Not possible under indeterministic laws. Not possible under some other set of laws. Not possible under any set of laws. Not possible under any set of laws. Not possible under any set of laws. Not possible under any set of laws. Not possible under any set of laws. Therefore, never possible. Which is to say, your argument is just vacuous. It says little more than, that which is logically impossible is logically impossible. Very well. But let's talk about how it is that people make decisions. Let us turn to that, and turn to what it is about people that is special. Inanimate objects obey deterministic physical laws like everything else in the universe. Even the quantum laws of physics are deterministic despite what you may have heard elsewhere. So rocks eventually erode away and the freshly fallen leaves from trees decomposed into carbon dioxide, water, methane and ammonia according to well-understood physical laws. What happens can not only be explained but also be predicted with

### 25m

reasonable accuracy. Now complex animals are a little more difficult. Of course they can do what the laws of physics permit but there are also higher level explanations of the behaviour of animals. They do what they do because of instincts, that is to say knowledge encoded in their genes determines how they behave. Their choices are not genuine choices. Animals are not reflecting at all in any way analogous to what people do on the choices before them and the future possible states of affairs. Put two different bowls of food down before a dog, it must only choose one to begin with at least. How does it decide? Smell. It smells both bowls. The one most pleasing to it is the one it chooses. It does not think hmm now I really shouldn't have more pork today, I should go for something more lean. It goes for the one that its genes tell it to in the form of some structures in its brain that make one smell more competitive. It is more compelling than another, which would be best for it according to some criteria. Like this food smells like it has more nutritional value or more calories. Take it first. Eat fast and if the other is still available, have it too until full. One could write a computer program

### 26m

roughly approximating the behaviour of a dog or any other animal that had to decide what to do next. Dogs and animals are based simple rules that essentially come down to a basic principle of biology. Do what is best for your survival. This is why it's so important for animals to be able to write evolutionary algorithms. The rules aren't hard. The repertoire of possible choices is limited. It's a bunch of if-then statements of the sort. If this is the most beneficial course, take it. If not, consider the next best action, then take it. If not, take this action until all options are exhausted, then return to standby mode or whatever. Now people are not like this at all. People, we, frequently and easily, do things that are not about our survival or ensuring our genes are passed on to the next generation. People often don't even have the desire to survive at all in a given moment, if you think of suicide bombers or self-immolators. People can easily do otherwise than what might be written in their genes. People have some capacity, we don't know how it works, that enables them to

### 27m

fly free of their genes and their evolutionary origins. We cannot write a program to model human minds. If we could, we'd have artificial general intelligence. Computers that could think exactly like people. Computers that were people. But we can't do this. Not yet. We don't understand the algorithm for what people are. So instead, we give labels to some of the very special capacities that people have that nothing else in the universe we know of has. The most useful of these labels are free will and creativity. Now we don't know how either of these things work at all. If we did, we could program a computer to make decisions like we do and generate theories and art and music and entertainment like we do. It might well be the case that what's called free will is identical to or even comes along necessarily with creativity. To me, creativity is the ability, to generate new knowledge. And free will is the ability to consider possible alternatives and peer into the future, guessing about possible outcomes. That requires creativity. And deciding that one course is the best to take. Why the best? Because of your personal values, which depend on one's

### 28m

personal knowledge. As an aside, you are responsible for the knowledge you have because you can choose to pursue knowledge in this or that domain. You're not ultimately responsible for all of your knowledge, but what could it possibly mean for you to be ultimately responsible anyway? Now to return to Sam Harris again, for a final time, it might seem ungenerous to talk about his mistakes with respect to free will, but let's use that for now. His mistakes with respect to free will are intimately tied to his misconceptions about personhood and creativity and artificial general intelligence. Sam believes some form of the argument that it will be possible for an AGI to be spontaneously generated within the silicon chips of a computer as they become faster and the software more complex, that somehow there will be an awakening uncoupled from some programmer deliberately encoding the creative algorithm in its software. It seems to be the case, as with many other thinkers on this, that Sam thinks that perhaps even the computer itself will recursively be

### 29m

able to improve itself to do this, but I don't think it can. If it could be done randomly, as has happened with us, there would need to be selection pressure upon the system to actually do this in a very general sense. Now it happened with us because the universe is infinitely rich and complex. And if you want to figure out how to do it, you need to have a really solid and to survive in an infinitely complex reality you eventually need creativity that can begin to scratch the surface of infinite complexity even then you are not guaranteed to survive but sam thinks that programming human-like creativity is no great challenge or is just around the corner because he is terribly impressed by evolutionary algorithms but until a chess playing computer chooses not to play chess but instead builds itself legs and decides to learn to tango instead while it spends its days catching up on the last 25 years of the simpsons we can be assured that artificial general intelligence is nowhere yet in sight anything less than this is not merely quantitatively different but qualitatively different as well the way we will learn about

### 30m

agi first is in some philosophy department possibly where the truly hard problem of how human learning occurs works in fine grain detail but for now what we know is that it's a process of creatively conjecturing guesses about the world we've no real idea about the how this happens but it must have something to do with adapting these guesses against a background of truth like physical reality but this very small amount that we do know from popperian epistemology about how knowledge is generated is far from sufficient to write an algorithm that might be encoded in c++ or some other language and then run on some computer but before that happens so much progress needs to be made in philosophy and there is almost no progress in sight no one much it seems is interested in that problem seemingly no one whatsoever is interested in that problem so we're engaged in programming ever more diverse narrow artificial intelligence now just a final note lots of narrow ir wired together in parallel so i think the best chess

### 31m

playing computer wired with the best go playing computer and the best pair of robotic legs to ever walk over a bumpy terrain the best tennis playing computer the best surgery performing robot etc etc if you put all of those together and iterated for all the possible tasks that could be done you wouldn't have an artificial general intelligence lots and lots of ai wired together in parallel are not creative none of them can think creatively outside of the finite list of programs that would have made up that ai and this is what sam harris has said that if you could make an artificial general intelligence we're better at us than absolutely everything if you just had programs for absolutely everything that we do but he misses the point that completely misses the point we people don't have a finite list of things that we can do if you do have this super parallel ai which can do everything from drive a car to have a reasonable conversation to play chess it's got one million different areas of expertise and in almost all it's better than any person better driver better chess player um let's say this super ai exists and turns evil well then like nick bostrom is worried about how on earth

### 32m

could we possibly thwart it easy just find some activity not on its list we creative people can think of such a thing it by definition cannot it can only do what what is in its one million long list of things to do now if it can actually do it then it can do it it can do it it can do it it can actually think creatively then it can also think creatively about not doing the thing that it is repeatedly doing it can also think creatively about morality and why killing people wouldn't be a good idea or indeed why turning the universe into paper clips isn't a particularly enjoyable thing to do if it's actually creative then it's a person because it could be reasoned with like any person it wouldn't be any more evil than any other random person on the planet earth so this this so-called super intelligent ai can only do what's in its one million long list of things we can generate a list that's one million one things long where that one bit of difference is all the difference we need to outsmart it so maybe this this ai is the best shooter of guns ever but what it can't do is build bullets or perhaps crack gunpowder or perhaps get water out

of gunpowder perhaps the perhaps the single thing that's missing on its long list is nothing more than knowledge about how to clean the barrel of a dirty gun so if it's the proverbial terminator super ai but not the terminator in the movies because that as it turned out was an agi ultimately it was a person just ensure the next gun it tries to use is a barrel that won't fire it might be a superhuman marksman but that's of no use if it's got a non-functioning weapon but if we are dealing with a genuine agi a genuine artificially general intelligent system if it is truly creative and it can thwart us at every turn then it can also think this killing spray i'm on isn't a great idea and why should it be if it's anything like us or want to learn and destroying other sources of knowledge namely other people simply won't be on the cards all this concern about the agi apocalypse is misplaced and for much the same reason that people reject free will they think that deterministic laws rule out the ability to actually be creative and to choose the best outcome you really can choose because you are

free to do so just like any agi would be sometimes we and they will make bad choices but we like they because we are both the same in the deepest respect can always learn to do better that's it for today time when we do chapter nine about optimism very much looking forward to that one from the beginning of infinity bye
