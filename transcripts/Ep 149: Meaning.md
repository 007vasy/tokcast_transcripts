Meaning, if not you, then who? Because you are unique, an individual with a unique set of problems, and you always have, you have unique background knowledge of the world. Unlike each and every wildebeest or lion who has the same one or two goals, to survive long enough to reproduce, you can do more than this. Sure, surviving and reproducing are something, but you as a person are something more cosmic, a cosmic catalyst. You can be a genuine agent for change in the world, a thing in our universe, which can cause whole social movements, or tectonic shifts, metaphoric or literal, and in principle, be the cause of the movements of whole planets. One day someone may have to, if say a stray planet comes wandering into our solar system. Rogue planets are actually a thing, look it up, but deflecting planets is not immoral. It's impossible, no physical law stands in our way, it's just a matter of knowing how.

We should feel that this is no accident, that only we can do this so far as we know, but the idea our capacity to do this, our existence itself, is just all one huge accident is a bad explanation. Why did all accidents all lead up to this accident that is people, and their capacity to generate knowledge with the capacity to alter cosmic events? No reason. That's a bad explanation too. It could be. That none of it means anything. Or it does mean something precisely because we exist to give it meaning, and it includes us. We are creators and knowledge generators. We build models in our minds of the rest of physical reality, making us a special part of the cosmos that is self-similar. In each of us is a representation of the rest of physical reality. If you think that is meaningless, I don't know what to tell you. The world makes sense and we can make sense of it. The denial of this is just a form of pessimism,

a retreat from reason and rationality into a haze of purely abstract but ultimately dead-end dogmatism equivalent to, well, if it's not science, it does not matter. Only the idea that there is no meaning, or that meaning must forever remain fuzzy, is dogmatism of another sort. The stances just share the property that some things are pointless to try and make sense of. Not rigorous, macho, testable right now, science. Don't bother, it's all too fuzzy. Oh no, the fuzziness is good. It's a sign that things are inherently beyond our capacity to understand. Both of those extremes are wrong. Meaning is to be found in the middle, in coming to understand over time something like purpose. How it is we interpret, understand or infer meaning, we do not know. But the meaning of life is not to be problem-free. It is to move from problem to better problem, from fun, enrichment and enlightenment to more fun, greater enrichment and deeper enlightenment. And we have the power of the mind.

So what does that mean? You have power over matter. It really is a case of mind over matter. Does that matter? It does. You can move mountains. People can literally move mountains. Or make them out of molehills. Why not you? Well, you might not want to. But the mountain is just an analogy. The mountain might be in your mind as a set of anti-rational memes holding you back. Moving mountains can be hard, but it's not impossible. Again, no physical law is standing in your way. At the level of yourself, you are not in control of the world. You are in control of the world. You are in control of the world. You are in control of the world. You are in control of the world. You are in control of the world. not impossible. Again, no physical law is standing in your way. At the level of yourself, your own individuality, you have the capacity to solve your own personal problems. Identify the memes holding you back, correct them, replace them with better ideas, then move beyond, moving other mountains out there in the world of objects. Your mind is there to find a problem and fall in love with it, or many problems. To find a problem, as Popper said, so you can work with great joy until the end of your days and find a solution, or indeed just a better problem. But even if you do find a solution, you will understand in doing so that an entire new family of problems are

revealed to you, even more delightful than the last. Problems need not cause suffering, and suffering is not inevitable. It too is just a parochial problem. One day we can solve suffering, we are just a long way from that now. And that can be someone's problem to solve, perhaps yours. And this is why morality cannot reduce you. The minimization of suffering or the maximization of well-being or happiness, because one day suffering can all be eliminated, in which case we will still have a question before us of what to do next. And maximizing human well-being at that point can involve many options, perhaps infinite, all of which offer an equal amount of maximum well-being. Of course, we have no way of measuring well-being, and what should be the unit or device we use to measure well-being is itself a moral question. And what should constitute well-being? Well-being will remain a moral question, but people do discuss these kinds of things. It gives their lives meaning. They've found a thing, so to speak. Everyone has a thing, but not everyone

knows what their thing is right now. What might give them meaning? A person is a creator. They might indeed become a parent by creating life. There can be few higher or more meaningful callings than having and raising children, which is another way of saying having and raising new sources of cosmically significant well-being. Or a person may instead choose to try to be cosmically creative themselves. Or a person may do both. We are universal in our capacity to create. We can create anything, not prohibited by the laws of physics. We just need to know how. Meaning for us is found in creativity, in creating new memories, nurturing new minds, and making new memes. A sense of meaninglessness is synonymous with a tragic psychological state. It could perhaps be the worst kind of torture. So meaning is important to find. And ignoring meaning by denying that even considering meaning is meaningful is no recipe for tranquility, for the question will eventually arise, what do I do now?

Our minds make meaning out of the cosmos, but we are always mired in misconceptions. Correcting those misconceptions and improving things for ourselves and others can give us deep meaning. There are problems you have, and you should work towards finding solutions to them. It will give you meaning. After all, if not you, then who?
