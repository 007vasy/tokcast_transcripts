So hopefully I am audible to anyone who's out there at the moment. So for reasons that will become apparent, I'm going to discuss today the purpose of philosophy and perhaps epistemology more narrowly as well, or at least what I see as the purposes of philosophy, analytical philosophy if you like, philosophy in the Western tradition, philosophy that helps us to understand the nature of science and mathematics and all those other disciplines, and not least of which is how to live a good life, that kind of thing. Tomorrow I'll be doing an event with Jeroen Broek and we'll be talking about capitalism among other things, and he's in Australia at the moment, he was in Brisbane for the last couple of days over the weekend, and he's in Sydney tonight and he'll be in Sydney again tomorrow. And there's a lot to talk about in Australia, philosophically speaking, at the moment. Not only because we are living at an unusual time where

### 1m

the Jewish people everywhere around the world are suffering a kind of discrimination we've not seen for many decades in Western countries, of the Anglosphere in particular, but it's been ramping up and here in Australia, in Melbourne, we recently had a terrorist attack on a synagogue there, which has affected people greatly. So I'll ask Jeroen about that, being someone who has served time in the IDF and who understands these issues really, really well. And of course we'll talk capitalism, from important and essential though it is, to our tradition of criticism, our culture of error correction, the most fundamental part of which is freedom of speech, or freedom of expression. Free trade, or capitalism, follows close behind because we want to be able to speak freely

### 2m

about the goods and services that we want to trade with one another, and how to improve them, or what's wrong with them, and how to generate more wealth. A key part of my epistemological worldview, shaped by Popper and Deutsch, of course. And last of all, the free vote. Okay, so these three things that I've talked about so often, frequently, I think are part of the explanation as to why we have rapid progress in the West, which is stable and able to be maintained in such a way that we can continue to accelerate the rate of progress and not go off the rails completely. This is why philosophy and epistemology are important. We want to know how to make the world a better place, and you might think, well, a scientific worldview is all that you need, and I used to think that. that. I used to think that. And so I'm going to tell the story that I've told quite often

### 3m

for reasons that will become quickly apparent, I will say. Because there are people who are very interested in philosophy and good on them. And there is an epistemology and good on them. And they want to read the books by David Deutsch and good on them for that because they've heard very successful people give high praise to the work of David Deutsch. And so they come to the book because they want to be smarter people. Or they want to have a psychological experience, almost something spiritual and mystical about it. But that's not the way that I encountered the work of David Deutsch. And I think that if you're coming to philosophy, your motivation for why you're coming to philosophy is important. I don't want to denigrate the idea that if you think that , philosophy is a very important tool to have in your mental arsenal as you go about the world.

### 4m

And so therefore, you're going to start with the ancient Greeks. You're going to make your way through Plato and Aristotle, Xenophanes. And then you're going to move on to the classical era philosophers from Hume and Descartes and Spinoza and Kant and Locke and more besides. And then into the modern day, you're going to read the book. And then you're going to read Wittgenstein and Heidegger and Heigl and Popper, perhaps. Maybe that's what you want to do. Maybe you want to have a large number of books that you can sit in front of and then quote extensively from those books. You can be a philosopher. You can do philosophy and you can understand philosophy and you can talk about the history of ideas and that kind of thing. Okay, you can do that. You may be in psychological distress and be looking for answers that religion hasn't given you and perhaps your counselor hasn't been able to help you with if

### 5m

you're someone who goes to therapy. So I can only speak for myself, but I think a lot of people are like this. And I have a feeling that Karl Popper himself was a little bit like this as well because Karl Popper begins his works with instances of where there's a problem coming from outside of philosophy. So what was my problem? I've told this story again and again. I apologize to listeners and viewers who've heard this before. But going into it, I desperately wanted to do astronomy at university. It's all I wanted to do, astronomy and cosmology, because I wanted to understand the deepest problems about the biggest things at the most grand scales. I knew the planet was big, but the solar system was bigger than that and the galaxy was bigger than that. And I was a little kid and I just thought, what's bigger than the biggest thing we know about? And the universe would just get larger and larger and larger and larger and larger. The more and more you learned about it until you figure out there's this thing called the Big Bang

### 6m

and all of cosmology, everything in physical reality ultimately can have its origins traced to that. And there's evidence that triangulates on a simple explanation, the Big Bang. Not to say the answer is given a final and comprehensive. No, in fact, they reveal more problems. I'll speak to any cosmologist about the many and varied problems to do with the origins of the universe. And so off I go from high school to university to learn all this stuff, be excited about it when I was. But nothing in high school much gave me an indication about the mystery that was quantum theory. And so going to a traditional university, doing a very traditional degree in physics, you get hit over the head very early on with lots and lots of classical mechanics and electromagnetism. All the stuff to do with forces and classic physics, classical physics, Newtonian physics.

### 7m

The physics of Maxwell and Faraday and so on. Not until second year, really. Really. There's some hint of it in the first year, but really in the second year, it's when you encounter relativity and quantum theory. And quantum theory in particular is the problematic one. And you learn about the twin slit experiment. And that, of all the experiments, early on that you learn about is the most mysterious one because you're told about firing single particles at this twin slit. And you know, you know about the twin slit experiment because in first year, they told you all about wave mechanics and what happens to water waves as they pass through a barrier where there are two holes or openings through which the water waves can pass. And once they pass through, they interfere constructively and destructively, producing an interference pattern. And you understand the explanation about how when a crest of one wave meets a trough of another wave, you get perfect cancellation. Destructive

### 8m

interference. Constructive interference is where two crests meet and become bigger, or two troughs meet and become more depressed still. So you can get bigger waves and smaller waves. And so wonderful. What a wonderful explanation. Hard to vary. Good explanation. But , then you are presented with this wonderful mystery. Problem. In quantum theory, that when you fire single photons or single electrons or even single entire atoms, one at a time, over time, the same interference pattern builds up. But you know for a fact that what you're firing are particles. And you can do other experiments like place detectors where the slits are and show that the particle that you fire remains a particle. Doesn't turn into a wave mysteriously once it reaches the slits. It's a particle the entire way through. But something must be interfering with that particle. After all, if nothing was interfering with it,

### 9m

then what you would expect as you throw individual particles through these twin slits is an image, a shadow of those two slits. But you don't see a shadow of the two slits. You see the complex interference pattern that would happen were you sending waves through these twin slits. But you're not. Sending waves through because, as I say, you can already do experiments to figure out what these things called photons or electrons or indeed whole atoms are. You can do other experiments called the photoelectric effect that show you there are physical collisions between these particles. Now, particles aren't point-like. They're more complicated than that. But they're not waves. They're not extended entirely throughout space. As David Deutsch explains in the beginning of Infinity, they're more like inkblots. And so I was struggling to understand that experiment in particular. And I read every popular science book I could get my hand on. And as the story goes, not until 1997, which just happened to coincide with when I was at university doing this,

### 10m

did I find the Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch. And I read that book, Chapter Two Shadows, and it solved my problem. What was my problem? Understanding what was happening. Being able to explain to someone else what was happening in this twin slit experiment. I could describe the experiment. I could describe the problems with the experiment and trying to understand the experiment. But I didn't have the solution until I read that book. And then I realized I had other problems. Because that was not the only explanation. I'd read the other explanations, none of which made sense to me. But the many worlds interpretation, the multiverse, made sense to me. It was logical. It was hard to vary. It made predictions. And it all held together coherently in very simple terms, as David lays it out there. As I say, wonderful sense of fun, of vertigo, of fun, of fun, of fun, of fun, of fun, of fun, of fun, of fun, of fun, of fun, of fun. Being on a roller coaster and realizing the thrill of understanding and a change in your perspective on the world. But other people would say, in fact, university lecturers and

### 11m

tutors and professors and so on, they would say, it's not important how you interpret these experiments. What's important is, can you use the formalism, can you use the mathematics to make predictions about what will happen? That is instrumentalism. Now, I didn't know, at first, how to argue against this. I wasn't sophisticated enough, knowledgeable enough, I didn't understand until, as I made my way through the fabric of reality and talked to other people about the fabric of reality so that I could have a deeper understanding of it myself and, indeed, interrogate David Deutsch, because he was very polite and helped me online via email and so on, to understand the finer details of all this. And then, to begin to recognize, that this shut-up-and-calculate, instrumentalist idea of, don't worry your pretty little head about what's really going on with the twin-slit experiment, just be able to use the Schrodinger

### 12m

wave equation, whatever it happens to be, in order to predict what's going to happen as a quantum system evolves over time. That's all you need to do. You just need to be able to solve the numerical problems. You don't have to explain it. You don't have to explain it. You don't have to explain what's really going on. In fact, what does this word really mean anyway? Instrumentalism is fine. Now, at first, I didn't understand why we couldn't just be instrumentalists. And David explains and unpacks throughout the book, in no other area of science do we ever do this. We don't say of the fossils, well, we can't possibly have an opinion on what caused these fossils. But we must remain silent on those things we can't observe. Gradually, after many months and indeed

### 13m

years of, you know, carefully trying to unpack David's work and Karl Popper's work, I then began to realize science is about explaining the seen in terms of the unseen. Science is about explanations because science is about explaining the seen in terms of the unseen. And science is about explaining the seen in terms of the unseen. And science is about explaining the seen in terms of the unseen. And we want to understand reality. We're curious about it. We don't just want to make predictions. That's a philosophy. And that's why philosophy is important. If you don't have a philosophy, that's a philosophy. Okay. To say, I don't have a philosophy. Well, what an interesting philosophy that happens to be. To claim you don't have one. And to claim that the only purpose of science is to make predictions, not to understand reality. Which, by the way, of course, this whole idea that science is only and can only predict the future. And that's a philosophy. And that's a philosophy. And that's a philosophy. And that's a philosophy. And that's a philosophy. And that's a making predictions. Only ever applies to theoretical physics or particle physics, perhaps. It doesn't apply to meteorology, where we actually want to know that the rain is being caused by the clouds

### 14m

that are coming. And there could be a thunderstorm. And we can explain why. Prediction coming from good explanation about what really exists, what that thing does, and what it's likely to do. Deeper principles about condensation and wind and so on. Biology, chemistry, geology, astronomy, all of these domains of understanding that we have, these subject areas, they're not primarily about prediction, but explanation and understanding. So that is how I got into philosophy and epistemology. I wasn't coming to it out of some deep, problematic teenage angst of a kind. I was thrilled to encounter physics, confused when I didn't understand quantum physics, and then thrilled once more when I encountered David

### 15m

Deutsch's clarity of exposition on something like the twin-slit experiment and then everything else. It just so happened, it just so happened, that when I was at university and doing mathematics, I also realized I really like this stuff called logic and computation. Now, I don't know why, but in my first year at uni, they forced the physics students to do an electronics course, literally about how logic gates work in the hardware of a computer. And gates, nor gates, all these sorts of gates. And so it's very logical. And I quite enjoyed that, even though I was forced into doing it. I thought, ah, this is interesting. And that led me off to the mathematics department, where they made me do lots and lots of calculus, but they also had options of other things you do. And I thought, ah, logic and computability. I want to do that one. And it just so happened, and in Fabric of Reality, that was a central part of the book, computation and Turing machines.

### 16m

And so I got to study that at university, alongside, in lockstep width, reading the Fabric of Reality. It was thrilling. You go off to the philosophy department, and then they teach more courses on logic and philosophical logic. And so everything for me cohered around the fact that I was formally studying a thing, and as anyone, who goes to university, and especially does a science degree, sometimes it is extremely dry, even if you have a great lecturer. And sometimes it's confusing. And so I felt so happy that I'd found the Fabric of Reality. It just happened at the right time, because it was explaining to me the contents of my university course that otherwise, I think, would have been far more opaque and confusing to me than what they were. He was David Deutsch, putting it in, simple terms, with a spin, the Popperian explanatory spin on things. And more than that, challenging my intuitions in the most profound ways. So for example, one part that I love,

### 17m

and that anyone who watches TalkCast will know, is chapter 10, The Nature of Mathematics. Here, the two, an area that I've been told throughout all of high school and at university, this is the one domain in which you can get absolutely certain truth. And David has that line that I've been told throughout all of high school and at university, this is the one domain in which you can get absolutely certain truth. I just quote again and again and again, Necessary truth is merely the subject matter of mathematics. It is not the reward you get for doing mathematics. How brilliant, and how beautiful. And it is not just a throwaway line that is equipped to be quoted now and again. It comes from David's own explanations about computation and physics. It comes from that area, because error is everywhere. No computer can avoid having an error correction mechanism because the errors creep in. Computation and proof, what we do is a physical process.

### 18m

It's the universality of computation. David's very area of expertise because he wrote the paper on it. And so even in the area of mathematics, nothing is left seemingly untouched by this Popperian and David Deutsch worldview. And that's why I came to it. And then when the beginning of infinity arrived, I realized even more, even more, was underscored the importance of philosophy. So while I was at university doing that first degree where I did physics, I started doing philosophy of science. And as I've also told the story, I did lots of courses in philosophy, classic philosophy. Ancient philosophy. But Karl Popper was barely even a footnote. You know, that guy who did falsification. And then the beginning of infinity came out, you know, many years after I'd graduated, many years after I graduated with that first degree.

### 19m

And although I'd done philosophy at university alongside of physics, I didn't really appreciate still the crucial importance of philosophy and having a rational worldview and having a realistic, philosophic philosophy at that. And so it was then that I sort of realized and I've come to understand myself that philosophy explains things like why societies differ one from another. Why some places like the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, places in Europe have had rapid progress, tend in the direction of peace and stability, while other places, I'm not going to go into too much detail about that, but I really have to say, that of course philosophy is a very broad subject. And it's a very multi-dimensional Знаменитый but you cannot separate out philosophy from the most important parts of human life and civilization. The philosophy is what explains,

### 20m

as long as you have a good philosophy, the right philosophy, how it is that human beings come to make progress through error correction. And what we are as people, what we are as people, For so long, I was interested in this question about what a person is because I knew that people were different. Consciousness, our ability to tell right from wrong, the capacity to suffer, to appreciate beauty. No, it's our capacity to explain anything, not in practice but in principle, to see problems and fall in love with them and to try to understand the solution by generating explanations about physical reality that we can come to reflect the rest of physical reality, as David says so eloquently in that TED talk, Chemical Scum, The Dream of Distant Quasars,

### 21m

that here in our minds, the mind of any human being on planet Earth, is a system, the human mind, abstract, running on this physical substrate that is the brain, that is able to look out into the world and reflect the world, model the world, and over time, correct errors in its own model of the world such that the model of the world comes to reflect the reality beyond, the objective reality out there, via this method of error correction. Now, this is explained by Karl Popper. These are not trivial things, this matter of error correction and problem encountering, and solution creating, and therefore the categorical difference between a person, which includes alien intelligence and AGI should it ever come, human beings, cousins and ancestors, and all other life and all other systems

### 22m

that are out there in physical reality. Those are not solving problems about how to explain the rest of physical reality, but we are, and because we are, we're able to gain control, of physical reality over time. All of this is the most inspiring picture of reality and rationality that I think has ever been gifted to humanity, because it goes beyond what any traditional religion has ever said. And what traditional religion has said has been wonderful in a sense, namely that human life is sacred, that humans are, in a sense, the centre of something important, the centre of God's concern, let's say. Okay, so religion gets something right that atheism, denuded of anything like that, doesn't. What David Deutsch does is put humans back into the centre in a sense, namely that people are a hub, as he says,

### 23m

of knowledge creation. We're not just a chemical scum that has arisen by chance in order to follow the same fate that every other species that has ever existed is going to follow, namely towards the road of extinction. We can solve our problems. We can generate knowledge. We can protect ourselves and thrive, not merely here on the surface of the earth, but off into the indefinite and infinite future. How inspiring. How inspiring indeed. So why do I begin with all of that? Because I think that if you come to philosophy and you come to religion, you come to epistemology, coming at it without first having a problem that comes out of science, you're struggling to understand why these scientific theories change every few years, what the role of experiment is.

### 24m

This is the stuff I was really interested in. Maybe you come from a historic, you're interested in history. Why do different people talking about the same events or different cultures talking about the same events disagree on the facts of the matter? Why? It's a philosophical question. It's not within history, but the philosophy of history. Or politics. Why shouldn't we have philosopher kings? And what is democracy anyway? What does free speech give us? Is free speech logically and morally prior to value free speech than the enterprise of science itself? Yes, it is. So you might come from philosophy. You might come from history, I should say. Or science. You might come from mathematics and want to understand, is infinity real? Or is the denial of infinity a part of rationality because we can never possibly observe or get to or reach infinity, something like that? Philosophy is there to solve problems

### 25m

in other subject areas. It can't just be done denuded from the concretes. And when I say concretes, I mean specific examples. You go to Karl Popper's work and you go to Conjectures and Refutations, and what you find is there are hundreds of references to what Newton was doing, what problem he was solving. Einstein, Bohr, Lavoisier, biologists, chemists, geologists, and physicists. Popper is talking about those concrete examples of things that happened in history, problems that scientists were trying to solve, where they went wrong, why they went right, and the role of the experiment, in differentiating between better and worse theories. And what a good theory amounts to. This is a unique picture of the world that you might get partially in some other places

### 26m

to some degree. But I don't want to rely upon my authority. As someone who read a great philosopher like David Hume, and I have great respect for the work of David Hume, I think, brilliant, British empiricist. But there's just a whole other level of sophistication, of comprehensiveness to the worldview of David Deutsch and Karl Popper that you don't get anywhere else. And it's not done in the abstract. You know, I'll be speaking to you, Ron, tomorrow. I don't know. I don't know. It will come up. But when I read Ayn Rand, it's very narrow. There are aspects of it that I think are absolutely brilliant. The defense of capitalism, the defense of individual liberty, I think are truly inspired and powerful. But the epistemology, there's a poverty there.

### 27m

There is a lack of grappling with what we're trying to do when we create knowledge, which is not to reach the final truth, not to get... not to get to the truth or justify our truths, not to rest upon certainty and dogmatically be committed to a particular perspective, but rather to improve and make progress by finding errors in what we already know, correcting those errors, and then guessing at what something better might be and then criticizing that as a community or as an individual. And thus, we make progress incrementally. So, I've spent a lot of time, actually, engaging the work of Ayn Rand, for example, criticizing it. But one thing I can say about Rand is she is... No one can say she's unclear. She's clear. There's clarity there, and I must respect that. I like people who are clear.

### 28m

And if they're wrong, I can say why they're wrong and where they're wrong. So, for example, Ayn Rand demands that we begin with a solid foundation of truth that we cannot doubt, the law of identity. She calls it A equals A. And upon that, we build, derive conclusions. So, we have an edifice of knowledge. It's a thing I've talked about time and time again. And I disagree with that, but full respect to her, she lays out the case, although I think it's wrong, because knowledge is more like a web. Any or all of it can be wrong at any given time. The truths that we find are mixed with misconception. And the conjunction of truth and falsehood is always false. Okay, that's logic. But what we're doing with construct knowledge is not just a logical process. It's not just a deductive logical process.

### 29m

It's a creative one. It's not inductive. It's not deductive. And forget abductive. That's something we'll try and insert another technical word in there as if you invent, a term and you've explained something. I disagree with that. It's a neologism, abductive. But it does mean guess. So, I'll give them that. But I'd rather just stick with guess. And guess, just like conjecture, and just like the word create, these things are open to interpretation. I can't be precise. They're always going to be ambiguous. And we don't know how they work. We don't know how we create explanations. We know we do. And we know that it's about error correction. So, it's not like we know nothing. But what we do know is enough to be able to say we don't understand it all because we can't program it. Another part of David Deutsch's work that is inspiring. A great heuristic. If you can't program it, you don't understand it. Okay.

### 30m

Now, people often ask me, what part of the philosophy of David Deutsch do you disagree with? And as I keep saying recently, because it comes up all the time, because people think that because I am so inspired by the work of David Deutsch, and I have spent hours and years unpacking the beginning of infinity, the fabric of reality, I promise I will be getting back to that very, very soon. Many other things have come in the way recently. And all the other associated podcasts and content that I've put out there, that they think I am an irrational fan, a fanatic of David Deutsch, and am unwilling or unable to critique any of the content of his books. But the thing is, that was already done earlier and elsewhere in places that people didn't see for the previous 20-something years that I've been familiar with this work. And engaging with people online

### 31m

and with David himself, trying to clarify in my own mind. I remember taking David Deutsch's task on email publicly years ago because I was, you know, a university student who was learning about Descartes. And I just assumed that, of course, of course you can be certain because Rene Descartes said you could be certain. That I think, therefore, I am as a necessary truth. And you've got that truth. You know you exist. And that's it. There's no way you can be wrong about that. I was sure. I was sure about many things. And I challenged David on them. And each time I challenged him, we had a, you know, conversation. And, and, I understood where my misconceptions were. So it's not like I don't understand the impulse. Reading something that you think is amazing and then now and again coming across something where you think that can't possibly be the case. I know better.

### 32m

It could be the case that you know better. It could be. Everyone can be wrong. We're all fallible. But with an effort, as I hope I've taken over the years, you can come to understand the other perspective. And you might even be persuaded by it, which I generally was. And so that brings me to someone who has claimed to have been persuaded and then has changed their mind and decided that David Deutsch's work is a dead end. And so I am going to go through and I'm going to go through and I'm going to go through and I'm going to go through and I'm going to go through some of this article that appeared during the week on X. It was an article on, it's been published on Substack and you can look it up. It's called The Deutschian Dead End by a person called Kazra.

### 33m

And it's subtitled Critical Rationalism is Full of Tortured Rationalizations. Now, I have read this twice. And I initially responded just on Twitter. And for whatever reason, the article is hit a nerve with many supporters of the article. And I don't know why, because as I read it, the first time I thought, this is just so far off base, so completely misconceived that the person either hasn't read the book or has done what Naval Ravikant has said that many people do with something like The Beginning of Infinity. They say they've read it or they've skimmed over it, but they haven't really. It hasn't gone in. And this happens even to the brightest minds of our age.

### 34m

There are many famous public intellectuals out there that I've talked about before who claim to be fans of David Deutsch and The Beginning of Infinity. And they're not. And indeed to endorse his worldview on things like knowledge and conjectural knowledge and good explanations and so on. And then they attempt to articulate part of it and they get it completely wrong. Or within a couple of weeks of saying that they'd read the book, you then hear them talk about knowledge and you hear them talk about how they're going to justify certain things as true or what the degrees of belief might be and you know, you realise we didn't really appreciate much of the central themes in the book. And so this, that I'm about to go through this article, is emblematic of that kind of thing where it is misconception piled on top of misconception piled on top of misconception.

### 35m

The mistakes mount, but more than that is this unfortunate condescension and this unending anger that permeates throughout the entirety of the article. It reads as if to say I understand you're he uses the word Deutcheum, okay? The author of the piece that is critiquing the work of David Deutch uses the word Deutcheum over and over again which is a tell. In my mind it's always a tell when people use the word Deutcheum because no one uses that term except the critics. It's like Randian. No one uses the term except the critics. They're not sufficiently familiar with the work to understand that it's not a word that's used and it doesn't convey anything. I mean what does it mean? What does it really label? What is Deutcheum? What is Deutcheum? I couldn't tell you. How is Deutcheum different to Popperian, let's say?

### 36m

There are things like, for example, optimism. Optimism in David Deutch's sense is slightly different to the way in which optimism is usually used because optimism, the word, like all words, and David is the first one to say, in fact I think it is one of, and we're going to hear the author of the work today use this word, quip. One of David's quips is essentially all language is ambiguous. All language is ambiguous. So we can't perfectly define, perfectly refine with absolute clarity what anyone means when they're discussing things like the philosophy of David Deutch. But you get as I say this, condescending anger permeating the piece by someone who says they were a fan or admirer of David Deutch, read the books but then ultimately at the end somehow although they were impressed come to the realisation that all of it

### 37m

is either false or so obvious as to not be worth stating. So it's hard to tell or what mind would on the one hand be thrilled to read something new like The Beginning of Infinity and then on the other, you know at every moment they're turning the page going wow this is really good stuff, but then and at the end they really enjoy it and they like it and for some years go by and then they realise upon talking to some other people, apparently this seems to be what has happened, reach the conclusion that it was all so obvious in retrospect of course it's obvious once you've read the book the way English grammar works to me is so obvious in retrospect, it's so simple that I don't know why anyone bothers teaching English to these figures of non-English because it's so obvious or mathematics

### 38m

mathematics is just logical, why bother learning any of this stuff, it's so obvious, it's so obvious that one plus one equals two that if you can accept that everything else follows this is the tone of the article, so again as I say the title of the article is The Deutschian Dead End by a fellow called Casra he begins with a preamble that praises David Deutsch as one of the most brilliant physicists and philosophers of our time the introduction begins and I hesitate to begin reading long sections but I'm going to have to if I'm going to respond to it, but it's just such a long article and the same errors sort of made over and over again but they do begin with this is about some of the technical details of David Deutsch's philosophy I can stop them there because it's not, it really isn't

### 39m

it at best is a very superficial overview that contains deep misconceptions about the entire project of philosophy, which is the way I began this live stream today what I was saying, and I'll emphasise it again is what The Beginning of Infinity David Deutsch's work more broadly on epistemology is about, Karl Popper's is trying to solve the problem of what knowledge is and how it grows what knowledge is and how it grows because if we can understand that, we can help it to grow faster, have institutions and traditions in place help to make progress faster because that's what knowledge really is all about it's about solving our problems and so we get better technology better cures, longer life healthier, wealthier and wiser all of that sort of stuff so we want to understand what knowledge is and our relationship to knowledge as knowledge creators

### 40m

that's the problem that's being solved by David Deutsch and Karl Popper when it comes to their epistemology what I want to say to Kazra, our author of this particular piece is what problem are you trying to solve because you can read the article for yourself and you realise no alternative is being offered what you get is essentially David Deutsch, Karl Popper, boo I don't like it, boo but there's no alternative offered at best towards the end we get something about meaningness and nebulosity, this weird thing that this fellow David Chapman has created which I've critiqued before which I've critiqued as being very very similar in spirit and substance to all those other relativists and postmodernists that are out there that fail to be clear enough and as David says

### 41m

one reason that you know in a philosopher's chapter 11 I think or the beginning of infinity a philosopher's history of bad philosophy a physicist's history of bad philosophy that way, that style of writing that relativists have that flowery, verbose linguistic technique is designed so as to hold the philosophy immune from criticism so it is chutzpah it is absurd for the author of this piece that I'm about to talk to you more about to say that David Deutsch is, and critical rationalism is holding itself immune from criticism that is some high level projection if ever there was some because the fellow here doesn't seem to have an alternative to point to, there's very little of substance to say well if critical rationalism

### 42m

is getting so much wrong what's the right view what is correct you can't a critique does not just consist of a critique does not just consist of saying this is wrong I don't like it this is wrong I don't like it you have to say why and what the alternative is I may feel uncomfortable with the idea that the universe commenced 13.7 billion years ago in a big bang because it may make me feel uncomfortable to for the question to arise how what caused it but if everything is pointing to that fact that the universe actually had a beginning it had an origin perhaps not in time but it had an origin time began and space began 13.7 billion years ago

### 43m

if we start to ask the question what caused the universe what made the universe possible any way you want to frame that you may feel uncomfortable and they may demand an answer like God and then of course if you dare to ask what created God or what caused God it's then that they say well God needs no creator so then of course you may as well say well the universe needs no creator and so on but it doesn't solve the problem of why the universe what made the universe possible let's say and so sometimes we can just say this explanation is not comprehensive there can be no completely comprehensive explanation the big bang opens up questions no one ever says that critical rationalism that epistemology the work of David Deutsch answers everything we ever wanted to know or could possibly ever ask about the nature of knowledge and how it grows as I've said before I am working on

### 44m

very slowly it's a long process I'm realizing on a constructive theory of knowledge I'm trying to figure out I'm trying to work through that it's slow going I'm doing other things as well but why would I do that if I thought that Karl Popper and David Deutsch had it all wrapped up had said everything that ever needed to be said ever on the topic of epistemology on what knowledge is and how it how it is created how it improves how it generates progress all that sort of stuff how error correction works then I wouldn't bother but I am because I don't think that there are final answers here there are just better and better explanations that get us nearer to what reality really is okay so let me see the author writes the author of this piece writes I should include some background on myself I originally discovered

### 45m

Deutsch about four years ago and I became obsessed I read multiple of his and Karl Popper's books papers lectures and interviews and took many thousands of words and notes on all of it I really felt like I was coming face to face with a profoundly significant set of ideas a deeply clear comprehensive and coherent picture of reality end quote so let's keep that in mind they felt as if they were getting a coherent picture of reality they were excited in other words I could have written something like that wonderful but at the end just keep in mind at the end he is going to accuse the very same content okay which he's just said is profoundly a profoundly significant set of ideas he's going to accuse it of being nothing but a set of obvious trivialities obvious truths and trivialities or something like that so how do we square this well it may not be a problem for this author and the reason it may not be a problem for this author is because he's coming from the school of David Chapman who doesn't mind a contradiction and

### 46m

why doesn't he mind a contradiction because his entire philosophy is to say that nothing that he does is actually philosophy so you cannot critique him for his philosophy because his philosophy is not a philosophy he's doing something else in which case I responded you know when this was raised to me that well Brett Hall you're taking this nebulosity stuff too seriously as a philosophy it's not a philosophy it's more like self-help or something like that I said oh okay well good on them then you know fill your boots with your self-help go for your life explaining that words don't have precise meanings no one ever said they did except for Wittgenstein certainly not Karl Popper that the words are nebulous and that reality is nebulous no one has ever denied this kind of framing of what language is we agree language is ambiguous Karl Popper said you cannot speak in such a way as you cannot be misunderstood it's always possible to be misunderstood language is ambiguous

### 47m

does that mean language is nebulous maybe okay you can use that word so it appears there's no debate but then as Jake said to Chris on the do explain podcast something like that or to David himself when I listened to that conversation which by the way gave me the feeling of okay Jake is asking David questions getting the answers and everything seems to make sense but Jake wanted to say something like well we're not just saying the language is nebulous we're saying reality itself is nebulous which again itself is an ambiguous statement all of the stuff is ambiguous the entire philosophy is ambiguous but then again so is everything else and to say that reality is ambiguous that's fine and I'll come back to that but I don't have any big dispute with that what I have a dispute with is what problem are you solving what is motivating any of these eruptions that Karl Popper and David Deutsch have got it all wrong if you're a person like me who wants to understand

### 48m

what is knowledge how does it grow how do we move from one problem to a better problem what are people doing with their minds when they encounter a problem and try and articulate the possible space of solutions what is happening there these are interesting fascinating questions how do we decide whether reality consists of forces of gravity or the curvature of space time what is the role of the experiment in any of this Karl Popper and David Deutsch provide answers for all of this and so when you say well they're completely wrong or it's a bunch of banal trivialities ok but what is the alternative to conjecture and refutation what is specifically wrong what are you objecting to rather than having an emotional reaction that seems as I say this kind of angry condescending tone throughout the thing so already he's arguing from a position of authority

### 49m

he's saying I've read David Deutsch's work and I've read Karl Popper's work and all these papers and things so I'm in a position to critique him now because his very next sentence after saying I really felt like I was coming face to face with a profoundly significant set of ideas he then goes on to say I now believe this was wrong and that I had fallen prey to a number of fairly obvious conceptual and psychological errors end quote fallen prey as if there is this net being cast by these nefarious Popperians and critical rationalists to capture and lure in young people and flood their mind with fairly obvious conceptual and psychological errors by the way it's all psychologising there's very little philosophy here but this is one of the other criticisms that I have of the David Chapman school of thought is that it is psychology you know he denies

### 50m

that he's doing philosophy anyway so you can't critique him on that basis uh um so you're going to hear some very heavy psychologising throughout the piece what David Deutsch or Karl Popper believe what critical rationalists believe what's going on inside of their minds again none of that is ever of much interest to me what X thinks about Y what this person thinks about that I'd much rather concentrate on the ideas why should we endorse the many worlds interpretation of quantum theory what are the reasons what are the ideas that lead us from a single particle twin slit experiment to a multiverse of fungible instances of all particles that we experience

### 51m

in our own universe how do we get from one place to another conceptually speaking like that I'm not interested in people's minds and what they think I'm interested in what the best ideas are that explain this stuff okay so I think the author of this piece Kazra was coming and we will see this he was coming to the beginning of infinity already filled with many psychological hangups and was I think expecting to get out of the beginning of infinity something other than what is being offered which is explanations of things like science and mathematics and progress and political systems the nature of physical reality it's not there as a self help guide but many people have rightly said that it has given them a sense of optimism in their life that inculcated as they were at school or university or elsewhere by the media

### 52m

with pessimistic prophecies of doom this was a great antidote but I can imagine that if you hear that kind of talk and if you hear other people talking about the beginning of infinity in these rapturous tones about what a wonderful book it is and how profoundly affecting it was to them that I can imagine if you are a person that that is already in some sort of distress psychologically let's say and you read the book and you think yeah this is profoundly exciting and whatever else I think there are some good ideas there and you get to the end of the book and you find your problems are still there and your personal life and whatever you might be angry because everyone else that you were listening to was saying how wonderful this is and you haven't had your life changed no one made the promise to you no one guaranteed

### 53m

that your life would be changed and so it's not the fault of critical rationalism or anything else that you were disappointed in retrospect with not having the profound experience that other people have people can have different experiences and different reactions to things and by the way a lot of what is written in this article and I suppose I'm really speaking to people who have already read the article but otherwise seems to be a critique of the beginning of infinity in a sort of hand waving way without actually of a quoting at length substantively the beginning of infinity we get quotes from Chiara Marletto's book quotes from Popper or Richard Rorty some of the authors other favourite writers and things but nothing really like here's a section from the chapter on optimism a nice excerpt and here's what I think is wrong with it there's nothing like that

### 54m

there's nothing like that okay so I'm just going to skip a bit a note on terminology writes the author in this essay I'll be grouping together the ideas espoused by David Deutsch, Brett Hall, Karl Popper and Chiara Marletto into one loose bucket which I'll refer to interchangeably as critical rationalism or the Deutchian or the Popperian world view okay nice to get name check there nice to be on a list of the author's enemies apparently I'm in very good company this is good again this desire to to have teams movements to align yourself with ideologies creates enemies this is why I don't like objectivism it's why I have an article out there on my own sub stack to give that a bit of a boost I think it's on my sub stack literally titled why I'm not a Popperian

### 55m

or why I'm not a critical rationalist and I'm not I think there are great ideas within Deutch's work and within Deutch's work the last thing I'd ever call myself is Deutchian it's very weird and I agree cultish I have great respect for Ayn Rand but I'd never call myself an objectivist I think there are some good ideas within Judaism can't call myself a Jew good ideas surround us they can come from any direction bad ideas can be found anywhere as well and so it's incumbent upon us all to curate our own way through the world rather than adhere to labels so I'm not answering to being a critical rationalist but I can say that I've read a lot of Popper and so therefore I can explain where this fellow goes wrong in my view so the fellow goes on and he says

### 56m

quote put most succinctly the critical rationalist mistake is that they view the world in terms of simplistic dichotomies end quote so they do this team of critical rationalists like it becomes very personal it becomes a and as he will admit himself this is a work of sociology which is bizarre and this is why I have such difficulty grappling with it because I like to do philosophy rather than psychology I'm not interested in what anyone what's going on in the internal workings of a person's mind because whenever I've talked about in the past and I have at length critiqued empiricism I've never been tempted to frame things in terms of like those empiricists over there they're so naive Hume and Locke and what a bunch of ignoramuses of course no I would like to outline my understanding of what empiricism is as being able to

### 57m

observe things directly and derive from those observations theories of reality to see you know the laws of nature written in the book of nature so to speak that kind of thing that's a mistake but talking about empiricists rather than empiricism I think it's a misfiring of something and it tends to get it tends to turn you know we have this whole problem with authoritarianism right now and identity politics it's just another manifestation of that attacking critical rationalists the group of people okay he goes on to say quote they formulate theories for how things work say how humans obtain knowledge about the world and then fit every conceivable piece of evidence into that theory end quote oh no

### 58m

I should say he goes on so the critical rationalists fit every conceivable piece of evidence into that theory making their ideas effectively immune to criticism end quote so he's using David Deutsch's phrase okay talking about how things can be held immune from criticism and trying to use it in order to critique sloppily the content of critical rationalism they formulate theories for how things work and fit every conceivable piece of evidence into that theory well no they don't they don't do that because they understand what evidence is and what the function of evidence is evidence is to decide between theories already guessed so already trying to say that this is how critical rationalists use evidence by fitting every conceivable piece of evidence in order to fit that theory just reveals

### 59m

a deep deep misconception about the world view and about evidence and just the basics of what the world view entails so I would implore Kazra the author or anyone who thought that there was merit in this piece to read for example the logic of experimental tests by David Deutsch and that can help you understand the role of evidence it's a refrain we hear over and over again but we're not as I will come to we're not going to be offered an alternative we're just going to be told over and again that this is critical rationalism going wrong so he's just said that of critical rationalists their ideas are being made immune to criticism and then he goes on to say quote the way I'll make many of the arguments in this essay is oblique rather than direct end quote

### 1h 0m

the irony the lack of self-awareness is astonishing but again the author I presume is going or could claim I'm not doing philosophy unlike David Chapman I'm a non-philosopher just writing things down so if you are going to write an essay that is a critique of critical rationalism but you say that your arguments are not direct but oblique what is that what is that having just in the prior sentence charged the people you are critiquing your opponents with holding their ideas immune from criticism he says that he's going to make oblique rather than direct arguments so let me be direct phrasing things phrasing your arguments in any way other than direct is a way of holding

### 1h 1m

your ideas immune from criticism saying that you're about to make oblique arguments rather than direct ones hold your ideas immune from criticism you are guilty you are guilty of the very thing that you are charging critical rationalism with it's absurd as I say David Chapman is chief among the writers and thinkers of this assertion assertion assertion and then you say I've got a problem with that and he can say well I'm not making a case or an argument I'm not making an explanation I'm not doing philosophy here this is the tenor this is the tone and the tenor of the piece

### 1h 2m

okay some of my the author goes on to say quote some of my points will be about the meta of Deutsch's statements rather than the substance of them I'll even make some sociological observations rather than purely technical philosophical ones again this is not it's something that Kamala Harris could have written to be honest some of my points will be the meta of David Deutsch's statements rather than the substance of them if you're going to critique critical rationalism or the work of David Deutsch critique the substance critique the ideas I don't know what else you're critiquing the meta the the the the motivations he had for writing the book some you know homespun psychology perhaps is being done here and making some sociological observations rather than philosophical ones when he said at the beginning that he was going to make

### 1h 3m

technical arguments about the technical aspects of David Deutsch's work and now he's saying he won't he's making sociological observations these are just sociological observations I'm not making an argument here I'm not making a philosophical case I'm making an observation he goes on to say quote I think this is necessary because as I'll try to demonstrate critical rationalism is based on a set of mutually reinforcing assumptions and framings that are effectively impossible to refute all at once purely on the basis purely on the substance of their claims a full stop end quote there is no basis of critical rationalism there's no fundamental place that you begin with critical rationalism there is a network of things that hold together that provide a lens through which to understand something like knowledge that's what it is what is this thing knowledge because we can't justify as true our beliefs which is

### 1h 4m

what almost all other epistemologies are about turning by the way epistemology into psychology if it becomes about beliefs and epistemology is not about beliefs it's about knowledge and knowledge can be instantiated in physical objects another insight from Popper that is so exciting but which the author here doesn't grapple with it is not impossible to refute critical rationalism all at once it's not impossible there's no physical law that says it could not possibly be refuted but the fact that no one has refuted it and spoiler alert nor does this also by the end of it refute anything in the oeuvre of Kyle Popper or David Deutsch nothing it is as I say Kamala Harris word salad type commentary the if you're not going to focus on the substance of the claims if you're not going to focus on the arguments if you're not going to deal in precision by providing quotes

### 1h 5m

why all the hate and anger why this emotional eruption about the work of Kyle Popper and David Deutsch I don't know I don't understand the motivation I could guess but again that's not really my thing to go into why people are compelled perhaps it's to get clicks we are in the age of look at me I suppose and so as I think the great Ricky Gerasis said some people think that the only way they can raise themselves up is by bringing down someone else so there's a sense of that throughout this the critique such as it is could have been written without mentioning the names Popper and Deutsch it would be harder but it would also be more pleasant to read because this constant refrain as they go on to say let me read it

### 1h 6m

quote there is no single definitive contradiction within the philosophy if there was Popper and Deutsch themselves would have found it long ago but it's possible to step just outside of the philosophy to see the web of framings rationalizations and everyday behaviors that make up the world view to see the problems in it the Deutschian world view is a kind of philosophical local maximum from which from which it's impossible to move towards greater conceptual clarity without first taking apart a lot of conceptual scaffolding end quote this is one of those hugely condescending parts of the piece and I get this impression from again people like Chapman and others because what they're saying is I was I understand the world view but I can do something better I have the capacity to step outside and I have stepped outside of the world view and from my vantage point from my God's eye view outside of the Deutschian paradigm I can see all the problems within it that you poor denizens who are still trapped within the Popperian world view cannot

### 1h 7m

possibly see because you are blind to the rest of wider reality and philosophy and nebulosity it's condescending that's the best that I can say about it incoherent is another thing I would say about it the Deutschian world view is a kind of philosophical local maximum local maximum from which it is impossible to move towards greater conceptual clarity why isn't David Deutsch's expression of how knowledge is generated with hard to vary explanations and the concept of the person as the universal explainer building upon the work of Karl Popper now had there been no David Deutsch would this author have said the Popperian world view is a kind of philosophical local maximum from blah blah blah now if it is a local maximum that means it is in principle impossible in principle impossible for anyone to improve upon it

### 1h 8m

anyway the whole thing is as I keep saying without offering an alternative a nice nicely expressed alternative philosophy of science or epistemology we've got nowhere to jump to even if we were persuaded in some way shape or form that in fact there was some merit to this author's claims because it's kind of a version of the Juham Quine thesis people could say all day long that something like conjectural knowledge as critical rationalism understands the term is wrong they can say that it's wrong they can say things like you really can justify your beliefs as true and any Popperianist says otherwise is just ignorant that that is not a criticism that's not a criticism of Popperian epistemology it's just an assertion there's no explanation but more than that

### 1h 9m

there's no alternative being offered you might say oh they're offering up justification and truth but okay how how do you justify something as true what is the alternative the author goes on to say quote a big part of my motivation for writing this essay is psychological no joke he continues what I would like to do is help a version of myself three years in the past who by virtue of being so absorbed in the Deutchian worldview felt a sense of existential loneliness and got into a number of silly arguments in which he tried to convince others of this you might go as far as calling it a religion okay so there I have compassion for this as I said this is a kind of angst and the angst appears to still be with the author the author has gone into the Deutchian worldview he's picked up the beginning and infinity expecting it to be able to solve his existential loneliness he has existential

### 1h 10m

loneliness so I get it I feel sympathy pity compassion all of that stuff I get it I get it but it's too high a bar to say that if you have existential loneliness and you see that other people over there do not have existential loneliness but indeed appear to be enjoying and having fun discussing this book called the beginning of infinity and so you pick it up thinking you know and perhaps you've listened to someone like me saying this is a wonderfully motivating inspiring book that provides you a worldview of how to think about things and you're listening and you're going aha I want that as well I'm over here existentially lonely and depressed and all sorts of terrible things as many young people especially men in their early twenties do indeed experience late teens early twenties existential loneliness and angst I get it so if you hear someone like me talking in these terms about this particular book my intention was never

### 1h 11m

was never to say this is going to cure all your psychological ills all of your personal problems will dissolve as you begin to appreciate the wonders of the cosmos and knowledge and infinite progress and all that stuff it's true that is inspiring and optimistic and for some people some of the time it can lift them out of their loneliness and pessimism but I would never mean to prescribe that as a treatment if you have existential loneliness I'm not going to say to you pick up the beginning of infinity I'm going to say find a friend and have a conversation or a family member and failing that go and seek some counselling get some help because the beginning of infinity perhaps perhaps the prescription is you need to already be a well functioning possibly even reasonably well read person this is why many people have said could we have a version of the beginning of infinity

### 1h 12m

that would be good for children children can read the beginning of infinity but there's background knowledge there background knowledge is a real thing you do want to have a reasonable vocabulary going into things an interest as I said at the beginning an interest in science that's where I was coming from I was coming from I'm really interested and excited about science and so it was just excitement built upon excitement of having my questions answered at just the right time so it all worked for me but if you're not in that position of having the first and primary passion and love of your life being science in particular physics then I don't know what to say to you because my experience is not of just being lost and lonely and angry and anxious about life but if you are in that position say again it's not the fault of the beginning of infinity of David Deutsch or Karl Popper

### 1h 13m

that you having read their work still feeling or having exacerbated your sense of existential loneliness it's not supposed to be you know Oprah Winfrey or David Deutsch oh I said David Deutsch Oprah Winfrey or Dr Phil's latest work on how to make yourself feel better about yourself people search for meaning I get it okay but as I say you have to cut me like a stick I'll say it again he's grounded in the problems of science he's explaining to you why it is people have these theories of electromagnetism or of light and lenses or of gravity

### 1h 14m

and orbits what orbits are and he's talking about all these scientists and what they're doing and you're thrilled as a scientist but if you're not a scientist and you read Conjectures and Refutations I can imagine you get bored. It's like open society and its enemies. If you're not interested already in history and politics and that kind of thing, you're going to get bored. It's not going to solve your problem. You have to be coming to philosophy from outside of philosophy. Philosophy is not a cure-all. You might come from psychology and have problems about theories within psychology, but the beginning of infinity, critical rationalism is not a self-help manual for fixing your personal psychological issues. That's the function of counselling. Unless you're already quite knowledgeable, very knowledgeable, I would say, possibly, about Popperian epistemology, and then it absolutely helps you. Once you're already psychologically stable

### 1h 15m

and you encounter a problem in your life, which is psychological, whatever happens to be anxiety, let's say, which we all deal with, critical rationalism can help with that. It can help with that. It can make you realise, okay, we make incremental progress here. Error is the natural state of things. Don't feel bad. Things tend to get better. Problems are soluble. All of that stuff. It works. But I can imagine if you're an extremist and if you don't have much background knowledge and you're already experiencing a certain degree of anxiety, depression, existential loneliness, that being told that problems are soluble is not going to help. But no one ever said that it would because your problems run deeper than that. They're personal. They're personal to you. Okay, so again, there's more. He's saying he's doing sociological stuff. So here he elucidates what he thinks is a mystery.

### 1h 16m

I'll explain that it's not a huge mystery. The author says, quote, I'm trying to explain the apparent contrast between a large number of people who are convinced that Deutsche's books, the beginning of infinity in particular, are some of the most powerful and important books ever written and an even larger part of the population, including much of the academic philosophy and a decent chunk of the scientific community who tend to respond to Deutsche's work with ambivalence, appreciating its value but not recognising it as revolutionary. End quote. Well, of course... Of course. Of course. Anyway, for one thing, it is exceedingly difficult to ever impress an academic about anything ever. When was the last time you heard an academic philosopher from a university say, this is a profoundly interesting book? Unless it's The Tractatus by Wittgenstein or something like that. Some book by someone long dead who's not Karl Popper. They don't. They're not excited about anything.

### 1h 17m

It's that sort of... The French intellectual... Arrogant air of I'm not impressed by anything. That kind of thing. So, of course. Okay, that's an impossibly high bar that we should expect the academic philosophy and the scientific community to be impressed by anything. If they appreciate its value, I think that's the best that we can say. But not recognising it as revolutionary. When was the last time you heard a majority of academics who self-identify as philosophers, a majority... By the way. Saying that a particular book is revolutionary. The only one that I can think of, really, is either Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions or Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations or The Tractatus. Either of those two. And then name the other philosophers throughout. More ancient history. No modern book.

### 1h 18m

Nothing from the last, you know, 30 years. So, it's no deep mystery. Like, Popper is hated. Hated by an overwhelming majority of the academic community. Ayn Rand is hated even more. People, especially academics, find it really and truly fun to hate Popper and Rand. It's a thing. It is a thing. It's a thing that's out there. In the academic community, in the intellectual community. You're a smart person, according to traditional intellectual culture, if you say you hate... If you say you disagree with Karl Popper. Because that elevates you, right? It's the Ricky Gervais thing. Some people think the only way they can lift themselves up, to elevate themselves, is to bring someone else down. Rather than contribute a new alternative, something new, something fresh, something insightful and exciting, you just say of those things, they're terrible, they're trivial, they're vacuous nonsense.

### 1h 19m

I don't know why. Really. And we've talked about this. Talked about this with David. Why is Popper so hated for so long? Why isn't he respected? Why don't people take him seriously? Now, I don't know. One reason is that Popper and Rand, both together, were highly critical of traditional educational institutions, of the university system, of intellectual culture broadly. And so, of course, your average intellectual isn't going to say, hey, I like Popper or I like Ayn Rand, to people who are very, very anti or critical of traditional intellectual culture. And so this entire piece that I'm going through right now is just on a continuum with that. It's on a continuum with many things, but it's on a continuum with that, that rejection of iconoclastic gadflies who offer you something new,

### 1h 20m

different to what went before. And also, of course, both Popper and Rand, and this is fresh on my mind, were great defenders of and exponents for the power of the individual and creativity. And this stands in stark contrast to all of academic and intellectual culture as it is today. We're swimming in the collectivist mindset. Most people are walking around with memes running on their minds that say, you can't do it alone. You depend upon the states or the community or whatever. You must rely upon us. You must do as you're told. They have that. And so when someone comes along and says, no, no, no, you individually can do it. You are special and creative. You can fix your problems or at least work on them and have fun doing so. That is a wonderfully uplifting message.

### 1h 21m

But it stands in stark contrast to the existing intellectual culture, which is far more collectivist. And so there is a kind of a default tendency for people to immediately react quite emotionally in the way that I'm reading here now to anyone who stands for individualism, optimism, and against the currents of what contemporary culture is. And things are going to hell in a handbasket and all that sort of stuff. Okay, let me keep going. I'm skipping a bit. And then so he's saying that of other people, they are often having read David Deutsch. They exist on the spectrum between this was silly and it was pretty good, I guess.

### 1h 22m

So some people apparently are on that spectrum between, or they could be transfixed or transformed, transfixed and transformed, or all the way to this was completely silly. Well, that's, you know, any book, right? Any book, I guess, is like that, can either transform someone or the person can walk away from reading it saying, that was silly. Why should David Deutsch's book be any different? Okay, let me read the next paragraph. He goes on to say, quote, Deutsch and the critical rationalists deserve a ton of credit. It's a fundamentally well-intentioned way of thinking. There are many basic tenets of theirs that I still agree with. Knowledge is possible and it's good. Humans have an important role to play in the universe. The scope of what we can know about the world is unimaginably large. Technological process, progress is a good thing, and much more of it is attainable. The thing is, all of these principles remain true, even without the tortured philosophy that Popper and Deutsch do.

Critical rationalism, adds an unnecessary pseudo-rigorous veneer onto these more basic and obvious principles. So, again, here we have, once more, the condescension. It's like, you know, patting a child on the head kind of thing. Good boy, you've tried your best, you're well-intentioned, but you're terribly wrong, you know. It competes with some of the worst intellectual posturing that you hear coming out of the university system that I see from time to time. He's saying of the work of David Deutsch, it's all obvious and basic principles. Well, if they were so obvious and basic, why was this author of this very piece so enamoured by them initially? Now that he knows them, of course they're obvious. Everything's obvious in the rear-view mirror. Okay. He goes on to say, quote, by the nature of Deutsch and Popper's ideas, ideas being abstract, this essay will also be necessarily...

### 1h 24m

Sorry, I'll start again. Quote, by the nature of Deutsch and Popper's ideas being abstract, this essay will also necessarily be abstract, end quote. No, that's not necessary. It's not necessarily abstract. Even if, which I do not agree with for a moment, well, except in the ambiguous sense which we'll come to, there's so much to say about just that one sentence. He's saying Deutsch and Popper write abstractly. I don't agree but let's go with him. Then therefore the essay will necessarily be abstract. False, absolutely. See my critique of the work of Ayn Rand. Okay. I've got a couple of episodes up there on TalkCast all about my criticisms of Ayn Rand's epistemology. Now, what do I do in that? I literally say that she philosophises in the abstract and I explain what I mean by that. So it's about thought experiments. imagining what would happen in this particular situation

### 1h 25m

or in fiction or, as I say, beginning with a foundation like A equals A as the law of identity and then from there deriving logically what the epistemology must be. I'd say that's doing philosophy in the abstract. I don't say it's abstract and just point it and go abstract. All knowledge is abstract. Kesra, Kesra, all through the earth. All knowledge is abstract. There's no escaping that. There's no escaping. Information may be physical. See my series on it from bit and it from qubit for more on that. Information is physical. But, but, knowledge is abstract, which just means it's substrate independent. You can represent it in a book. You can put it as pixels on a screen. You can put it as neural firings in your mind, sound waves as I speak. The abstract knowledge, the message is the same in each of those cases

### 1h 26m

if you're trying to convey the same piece of knowledge. The knowledge is not identical to any of those physical instantiations. It's an abstraction. So when you say Popper's ideas are abstract, what do you mean? All ideas are abstract. All ideas are abstract. I think what he's trying to say, and incorrectly, what he's trying to say is it's just philosophising without contact with reality. Physical reality. And yet, again, I want to say, I'm trying not to just say, you know, rely on my authority as someone who has read this stuff, but I'm going to have to say it. I've read Hume and Spinoza, Leibniz and Aristotle, Kant and Locke and Mill and Adam Smith. I've read these guys. You want to talk about doing philosophy in the abstract? Sometimes some of them do tend in that direction.

### 1h 27m

Certainly Spinoza, for example. But Karl Popper and David Deutsch, par excellence, escape from that because they talk about concrete particular instances. Here's the twin-slit experiment. I mean, how much more concrete can you get? This is what happens in this experiment in real life. Here is what happened during Eddington's experiment when they were trying to distinguish between Newtonian gravity and the theory of general relativity. That's concrete. Concrete stuff. Every other page of Conjectures and Refutations talks about another scientist or another philosopher or another thinker doing a particular thing and solving a problem. And him explaining to you how conjectural knowledge works. David Deutsch, likewise, talks about specific things. Him looking at something like a photographic negative where the smudge looks like a galaxy, but then he realized it's smudge, and so there was no actual civilization there that he was imagining into existence. It's a concrete thing. It's not philosophizing in the abstract. He's not saying, imagine the situation.

### 1h 28m

No, he's telling you about things that actually happened throughout the history of science or his own life or in politics. It's not abstract. It's the furthest thing, philosophically speaking, from abstract that I have ever read, and I've read a lot. But again, that's an appeal to authority, to my authority as someone who has read stuff. But all I can say is, if you haven't yet read The Beginning and Finishing, but I think just about everyone who watches my stuff now has, do you think it is highly abstract? Do you think it's highly abstract? You read The Fabric of Reality, and he talks to you about Galileo. He talks to you about him being hauled towards the Inquisition. This happened. Now, why is he talking about a specific instance? Because he's talking about the role that the church played in deeming certain ideas as true, no matter the evidence, what a theory and what an explanation is

### 1h 29m

with specific examples. So it's not abstract. This is just a throwaway attempt at insulting someone because the author of this piece thinks the word abstract is pejorative. Now, it's not pejorative because it actually labels something that's real. There's physical stuff and there's abstract stuff. There's literally something called the reality of a chapter, chapter five, beginning of infinity, I think, the reality of abstractions. So to say that David Deutsch's ideas are abstract is just a simple statement of fact. Of course they are, because they're ideas, and all ideas are abstract. All knowledge is abstract. That's what abstract means. It means not identical to matter. It's not just the atoms. It's not just the neural firings. They encode something, information that tends to get itself copied. Okay.

### 1h 30m

Oh, just the next sentence is great. The author says, quote, to combat this, let me ground the whole essay in a concrete empirical bet. Popper's ideas about epistemology and David Deutsch's extensions of them will forever remain in the footnotes of the history of philosophy, end quote. So again, the lack of self-awareness is astonishing. How can that, a bet about, about forever, he's literally said that, David Deutsch and Karl Popper's work will remain forever, forever in the footnotes of history. Let me make you a concrete bet. Well, okay. When we get to the end of forever, then I'll be able to collect all my bet, will I? That's not, that's not a concrete empirical bet. That's a ridiculous assertion. That's just an attempt to insult the work of Karl Popper and David Deutsch. There's no way you can make a bet about forever, what's going to happen at the end of forever. I, I bet you the universe won't last 55 trillion years.

### 1h 31m

It'll last forever. Or just say, I bet the universe will last forever. Ready to collect, I'll bet you a million dollars that it lasts forever. But why bother prophesying anyway? Even if he had said, I bet Karl Popper and David Deutsch's work will be a footnote in exactly 30 years, from now, and no one will be talking about them anymore. Like, I'd happily take that bet. I'm sure they will be talking about them. But what does it matter? I mean, David Deutsch, it's not, you know, it's an attempt at an insult, but remember, David Deutsch himself says of his own work, that it's footnotes to Popper, and many of us object to that. The author goes on, quote, Popper's falsificationism, which was the main idea that he's widely known for today, will continue to remain the only thing that he's widely known for. End quote. Popper is indeed widely known for that,

### 1h 32m

but only within certain circles. Anyone who's not interested in the philosophy of science won't know that. And indeed, people who are more interested in political science know him for things like the paradox of tolerance. In fact, I've met some people, I've spoken to some people who only know Popper for that. Oh, isn't he the guy that did the paradox of tolerance thing? So, you know, I don't know what the point of saying any of this is. Oh, Popper is never going to... There's not many famous philosophers, period, right? What is Wittgenstein best known for in the wider world? I don't know. If I asked a random family member or a friend, what does the name Ludwig Wittgenstein mean to you? They'd likely say nothing at all. Was he a historian? Was he a philosopher? Was he a philosopher? Was he a philosopher? Was he a historian? Was he a scientist? They wouldn't have a clue.

### 1h 33m

Karl Popper likewise. Widely known, presumably here, you know, means within academia. Okay, fair enough. Big deal. The author goes on to say, the frustrating fact that Wittgenstein is widely regarded as a more influential philosopher than Popper will continue to remain true. I agree, but who cares? Educational institutions across the world love Wittgenstein. I know. I've talked about that at length before. And they detest Popper for reasons I've already articulated here in this response. Okay. Goes on to say, critical rationalism is a kind of philosophical dead end, the Deutchian dead end. I think he thinks that the alliteration somehow makes a deeper point than what it does. Deutchian, as I like to say, isn't a word, except among the critics of the work of David Deutch, who are often angry, emotional people.

### 1h 34m

I don't know why. Then there's a long quote from Chiara Marletto that the author has inserted here. And he writes in response to Marletto, Marletto, quote, Marletto claims that Popper has elucidated the process by which new knowledge is created, but has he really elucidated anything? This passage exemplifies one of the central critical rationalist tendencies, framing your theories in terms of highly abstract concepts, blah, blah, blah. There's nothing here, okay, as I say, this is the third time I'm going through this, that actually offers us any reason to doubt the critical rationalist claim or the Popperian claim that knowledge is generated via a method of conjecture and refutation. Like, in fact, the author provides a reasonably good summary

### 1h 35m

of what critical rationalism is, but he just says that he doesn't like it for some reason. He says, what makes critical rationalism appealing is the way it seems to unify disparate ideas. It literally unifies all of human activity into one big category of knowledge creation via conjecture and refutation. Well, I wouldn't say all of human activity, but never mind that. As you're going around, you're going around, you're going around, you're going around, you're going around, you're going around, you're going around, you're going around, you're going around, you're going around, you're going around, you're going around, you're walking around, you're creating conjectures and criticising them. Yes, evolution is also doing the same thing, creating and criticising implicit conjectures. Not really, not really. There's a stark difference between explanatory knowledge and genetic knowledge. Whether we can consider a mutation a conjecture or not is stretching things a little bit too far. He goes on to say, everything is about knowledge. DNA contains knowledge. Technology contains knowledge. All of culture is a bunch of knowledge. What distinguishes good art from bad art is the fact that it has more knowledge. I don't know about that. But this is the idea of knowledge without a knower,

### 1h 36m

objective knowledge, which the author doesn't grapple with much at all. The word objective doesn't appear here. There's very little contact with fallibilism and what fallibilism is all about as well, which I think is an inspiring part of the philosophy, to talk about how everyone could be wrong and the way in which we improve is by, identifying errors and correcting them, and we should expect always to be laboring under a misconception to some point. But we can find some truth some of the time by generating good explanations of the physical world. So the author then concludes that section by saying, to be fair, Popper and Deutsch's epistemology goes deeper than this idea of conjecture and refutation. And so on. But, again, I say, there's nothing, there is nothing in this piece or the work of David Chapman

### 1h 37m

or anyone else who, although they say things like, it's a bunch of banal trivialities and obvious claims, they don't say, well, what's wrong with saying that the growth of knowledge is about conjecturing new ideas and then attempting to refute them and the ideas, you know, that are out there. The ideas that survive that process, that evolutionary process, are the best ideas that remain in place until such times we find error with them. Now, once you understand that, of course, everyone who sufficiently well understands that goes, how could it have been otherwise? Of course, that's so obvious in retrospect. But saying it's obvious in retrospect is not a criticism of the idea. F equals MA is obvious in retrospect, false though it is. Learn, the special theory of relativity, and you'll go, amazing, obvious in retrospect. I wouldn't say a bunch of banal trivialities.

### 1h 38m

Okay, now there's a section titled, observation is not always theory-laden. Again, spoiler alert, we never find out when, under what circumstances, we can actually have direct observation without it being theory-laden. We just get listed, you know, like, you can obviously, as obviously you can directly observe what clothes you're wearing, and we'll see this. Okay, so the first example that the author tries to hold up as being a refutation, but not, a refutation of this idea that observation is theory-laden is where he says, quote, a statement that you think might naively, a statement that you might naively think of as purely observational, quote, the temperature of the water in this cup is 40 degrees Celsius, is actually loaded up with a bunch of implicit theories and concepts like the concept of water temperature dimensions, the notion of Celsius, the idea of numbers,

### 1h 39m

the idea of a cup. So when you make such a statement, it's not a pure objective observation because it carries this baggage of implicit theories with it. There are even theories embedded in the very structure of the language you're using, and so on and so forth. All quite right, okay, but remember, the author is disagreeing with that. He's telling you what theory-laden means, but then he's going to say that, he doesn't agree with it, that not all observation is theory-laden. But even in that list of things, he misses perhaps the most crucial part. If you are saying, for example, the water is 40 degrees Celsius, the more important theory-laden-ness aspect of that, the reason why you can't just say, we look at the thermometer, it says 40 degrees, therefore it is 40 degrees, is because we have to say, we have a theory about thermometers, measuring devices, being physical objects, obeying the laws of physics. None can possibly be perfectly accurate.

### 1h 40m

And so, in fact, a good Papirian, or someone who has read the work of David Deutsch, will know very well that saying, strictly speaking, saying the water is 40 degrees Celsius is meaningless, meaningless, on the critical rationalist's view. Why? Because it doesn't mean anything to say that something is 40 degrees Celsius, unless you give me the uncertainty of the measuring instrument. Is the measuring instrument plus or minus 10 degrees Celsius? In which case, it's not really 40 degrees, it could be as high as 50, as low as 30. In truth, when physicists and chemists quote numbers like this, they say it's 40 plus or minus 0.5 degrees. Because we have a theory about what temperature is and how the measuring device works and why it can't possibly just deliver us the truth and even saying that it's within that range,

### 1h 41m

39.5 all the way up to 40.5, we could still be wrong. Our theory could be wrong about how the thermometer works. And perhaps the thermometer only works at sea level or something like that. Who knows? It could be all sorts of... Aspects of what we assume to be going on, which just aren't so. The author goes on to say, why is the theory-ladenness of observation so important? This brings us to the second Popperian principle, which is that the truth is not manifest. Popper stakes this claim in contrast to some other philosophers that claim we can have direct access to the truth of the world through our senses. Popper very rightly points out the truth is not obvious because we can be deceived in many ways. Okay, end quote for the moment. So, again, it's one of those sections, and this is really a theme throughout this article. He agrees with Popper. He agrees, agrees, agrees, but then just says he doesn't like it for some reason.

### 1h 42m

So here he's agreeing with Karl Popper that seemingly the truth is not manifest, but then he's going to contradict himself later on. Okay, anyway, Popper very rightly points out that the truth is not obvious because we can be deceived in many ways. Okay. There are countless examples of this, from mundane optical illusions to errors in our measuring instruments to superstitions that taint our experience of the world. All these are sources of fallibility that act as barriers to our direct access to the truth. So, remember, end quote, the reason, aside from the fact that it's simply true that the truth is not manifest, a motivation, an impulse for focusing on theory-ladenness, focusing on whether or not truth can be manifest, you know, you just look and you find the truth, is to reject authoritarianism, authorities anywhere, to reject dogma. As Popper says,

### 1h 43m

the doctrine that the truth is manifest is the root of all tyranny. It's the cause of tyranny. If you think you've got the truth in hand because you've read it in the holy book or you've seen it, you're liable to defend it with your life. A person who claims truth is manifest will insist that they have the truth in hand, therefore they have a special authority over it and over us, over everyone else. It's an old impulse. If someone stands up and says the truth is not manifest and you don't like that because you think you've got a special insight into the truth, you are aping an impulse that has a long history that almost everyone ever, has had a tendency to pursue. Which is to dogmatically adhere to particular ideas that you have an emotional attachment to. To say,

### 1h 44m

this is the truth, it's manifest to me, and I demand that you agree with me. So the author of this has rediscovered that. It could be the case that because David Deutsch and the beginning of infinity and Karl Popper's work are reacting against the misconceptions of people who made errors earlier and elsewhere, that if you don't already know about the history of ideas, if you don't already know science and philosophy, if you don't already know at least some of that, having read it, whether at school or university or in your own time, if you don't understand the existing literature and therefore have an appreciation of why it is that Popper and Deutsch write the things that they do, then I get it. You read Popper and Deutsch, you read the beginning of infinity, imagine it's one of the first long books you've ever read, you get to the end and you think, wow, that's amazing, that's really insightful, that's interesting. But if you never read the false stuff first,

### 1h 45m

if you weren't already taught the false stuff first, maybe when you encounter the false stuff, it then seems like it is a revelation because it disagrees with what Popper and Deutsch say. But you've got things around the wrong way. It's one theory, I'm taking it too seriously. But most people, most of the time, will have been inculcated at school with this idea that, you just look at the thermometer and it tells you the truth. Truth can be manifest, you can get to certainty, for example, in mathematics, all of that sort of stuff. That's usually the operating system that people are carrying around with them. And to undo that, to undo the idea that you can't do anything about it, you can't do anything about it, you can't do anything about it, you can't do anything about it, you can just look at the world and understand reality. You need, well, Karl Popper and David Deutsch's work helps.

### 1h 46m

Okay, so the author goes on to say, now to see the limits of both of these claims that observation is theory-laden and the truth is not manifest, you need to appreciate the underlying frame in which they're made. The underlying assumption here is that we as humans are irrevocably cut off from the actual objective world, only making tentative conjectures about it. Unable to ever verify anything. End quote. No, incorrect, false, utterly. We're not cut off from the actual objective world. No one ever said that. No one's ever said that. We are part of the actual objective world. We are minds running on brains. Now, it's true that our access to the objective world beyond us is via channels of information. Physical processes still, but we're not cut off. We just have a need to interpret what the signals from that actual objective world mean. How to explain them.

### 1h 47m

We're part of the world we're trying to explain. But it's true. Unable to ever verify anything we know. It's got verify in square quotes. True. Verify means establish as once and for all finally true. Absolutely true. Without error true. Infallibly true. It's always saying that that is impossible. It's an impossibly high standard. And anyway, an undesirable standard. Because if you were to get there, if you were to get to this final, ultimate, inerrant, infallible truth, progress would stop. You'd be there. You'd have the answer. And you could stand upon the summit of your verified truth and tell everyone else that because you are in possession of the truth that they should listen to you. You cannot be wrong. There is no error in the ultimate truth. There's been a long history of that. The author goes on to say that critical rationalists say that the entirety of our knowledge is, as they put it,

### 1h 48m

a bunch of unjustified untruths. But not the impression the author gives there is as if to say all untruths stand on equal footing. It's quite right that the physics of truth is not the truth. Galileo is better than the physics of a random hobo on the street that's just guessing at what the laws of motion are. Galileo produced mathematics and theories and explanations that were better than any random guess. Newton improved on that. Einstein improved on that. Quantum theory, quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics improves on that. We improve. We don't get to the final truth, so they're all untruths. They're not the final truth. The entirety of our knowledge is, as they put it, a bunch of... It's as if to say that this is all that's being said about knowledge. No, it's not.

### 1h 49m

Poetically, as I like to say, David Deutsch has explained that knowledge is information that, once instantiated in a physical substrate, tends to cause itself to remain so. Caramelita. Knowledge is resilient information. It's information that solves... It's information that has causal power. It's information that is useful, tends to get itself copied because it's useful, and it's useful because it solves it. All of this coheres together into this grand explanation of what knowledge is. It is positive and uplifting, and it's just a shame that, for whatever reason, this author, like so many before, exists in a long history of people who demand dogma, that have an emotional reaction to someone who says, knowledge is conjectural, we make errors, all that kind of stuff. This is my favourite part that I did react to on X. He says, quote, The critical rationalist picture of the world is one of radical scepticism,

### 1h 50m

born of a metaphysical tradition dating back hundreds of years to Descartes and others, which Deutsch and Popper never seriously questioned, end quote. Now, that's hilarious for numerous reasons. Descartes is never seriously questioned. Deutsch, for example. Well, both do spend quite a bit of time critiquing Descartes. And as I say, I even challenged David Deutsch with this myself, and I understood his perspective because he does spend a long time in the fabric of reality, providing what I would regard as a unique, original critique of Descartes' position that I think, therefore, I am. It's a necessary truth. It's a solipsistic idea. So the fact that this author doesn't understand that both Popper and Deutsch do have a critique of Descartes reveals a rank ignorance

### 1h 51m

about the subject that he's writing about. By the way, the critical rationalist picture of the world is one of radical scepticism. Well, it says two things. One, the writer, the author, doesn't know what radical scepticism is. And number two, certainly doesn't know what critical rationalism is. Remember that scepticism, radical scepticism, says that you can't possibly be wrong about anything because there's nothing to be wrong about. You're sceptical. Knowledge isn't possible is the sceptic's position. Knowledge isn't possible is the sceptic's position. I'll say it again. So how can a critical rationalist be a radical sceptic? For a radical sceptic is one who says there's no possibility of knowledge, but a critical rationalist is one who says there's no possibility of knowledge. A critical rationalist says knowledge absolutely exists. It can be instantiated in physical objects, and this is how it grows. It's a real thing. They're opposite to each other, but this author is conflating them together. And worse, fallibilism is the one,

### 1h 52m

fallibilism combined with realism, as I say realism, with Popper and Deutsch are both realists and fallibilists. The realist says objective reality exists, something the sceptic would deny, something the radical sceptic would deny. They're basically on the same side as the relativist. There's no... There's no truth. There's no reality. It's all going on in your head or something like that. And fallibilism says you can be wrong as a factual matter. It's always possible to be wrong, but it's only possible to be wrong if there's something to be wrong about, something objectively wrong to be wrong about. You can't be a fallibilist or a critical rationalist unless you deny scepticism. Unless you endorse the objective reality of the physical world, to say that stuff exists beyond your mind and you can be right or wrong about it. You can be right or wrong about it.

### 1h 53m

Now, this nebulosity stuff says, who knows? It's very hard to tell. There's no real sense in which you can be right and wrong about stuff. It's all nebulous. It's just a grey goo of ideas. It doesn't really help us to make progress. It might be emotionally helpful, and I think this is one of the reasons people are attracted to it. And I get it. We can sort of begin to do psychological analysis on our author here, that he's admitted already that he was an angsty person, he was in emotional distress, he was existentially lonely and so on and so forth. And he didn't find fulfillment in the work of Karl Popper or critical rationalism or anything. And so he's found David Chapman that speaks in these flowery terms. And great, he needs psychology. I get it. But none of his cry for emotional support and help

### 1h 54m

is at all a refutation. And I feel sorry for him and I have compassion. But none of it is a critique of critical rationalism. None of it's a refutation of critical rationalism. In fact, it's silent. It's just he's not happy. With stuff. He goes on to say, quote, in this picture, the critical rationalist picture, we are always groping around the darkness of a cave, mired in our infinite ignorance. This picture misses something absolutely crucial, which is that we as humans are fundamentally part of the objective world. We are embedded in it and even continuous with it rather than irrevocably severed from it. And it's quite, no one ever said, I want to quote page number, chapter number, to say, that we are irrevocably separated, severed from the rest of physical reality rather than being a part of it. It is part of the explanation following from the universality of computation

### 1h 55m

that the mind of a person is part of physical reality. What else could it be? What else could it be? It's a mind that is coming to resemble, as I already said, the rest of physical reality. How much more connected? How much more connected to physical reality can you be than that? Being able to conjecture ideas and test them against that physical reality gives you a special relationship with physical reality that no other organism, no other species, the non-human species, has or enjoys. That's a deep connection to physical reality, our capacity to explain it. Now, why this author wants to attribute to critical rationalism, to Karl Popp, to David Deutsch, to myself, to Chiara Marletto, et cetera, positions we do not hold, I don't know, apart from that lazy old tactic of straw manning, just saying, here's what they think, that we are severed completely from reality,

### 1h 56m

that we're not a part of it. No one ever said that. Quite the opposite, the absolute opposite. But to say that we are, he says, we are embedded in it and even continuous with it. Well, what does continuous mean? Well, I can agree that, okay, well, the mind runs on the hardware of the brain, okay, and that's part of the body and the body is breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide. So in some sense, I'm continuous with the atmosphere and when I dive into the pool and I'm surrounded by water, I'm skin is continuous with the water. I don't, it adds nothing. But what I would say is we've got a problem with ambiguity. The very thing that these people are holding up, is central to their understanding of the world, nebulosity, is already explained by both Popper and Deutsch. We use the word ambiguous to describe language.

### 1h 57m

Though we can't be perfectly precise, error is everywhere, misconception is everywhere. It's as if they're, they are the ones groping in the dark for critical rationalism and they've got a mangled version of critical rationalism. They can see, that there's truth there and they're angry because they didn't get there first. And I see a lot of this when it comes to Karl Popper. People rediscover it. What David Deutsch does is to add to Karl Popper an inspiring vision. This is the most, my favorite part of the book. Of, the individual as a creative, crucially important entity with the potential to change the universe. Never before has such a clear statement of that fact

### 1h 58m

been expressed in text that I'm aware of. Bronowski had some very positive things to say and the ancients had things to say, but never before blended with the physical sciences has a philosophy of optimism of that kind been articulated. That is something to be celebrated rather than denigrated. And it's not obvious because the overwhelming majority of people right now agree with Hawking and others who say that people are very limited in their capacity to be able to do anything. Dawkins talking about middle world and our incapacity to understand things. Neil deGrasse Tyson, one of the most famous people in the world for his work is David DeWitt. He wrote a book called The Only Way that Would Be Interested Going to Mars as if there was a global geopolitical catastrophe. It's all false and it's all anti-human. What David DeWitt does

### 1h 59m

is bring to critical rationalism an optimistic cosmic view of humanity. And it's quite right for people to be inspired by that and uplifted by that and maybe even joyful about that. And why there's this impulse to reject it and to be upset by it and to convey a condescending anger as I keep on saying about the work of David DeWitt or anyone who reads David DeWitt and enjoys it, I don't know. I don't understand the impulse. Why waste your time being angry and critiquing it? If you have an alternative like apparently David Chapman does, clarify it for us. Please. I've read the Chapman stuff. I've listened to Jake try and explain it. What I hear from Jake is again philosophy in the abstract. I don't hear let's talk about

### 2h 0m

anything from the discovery of DNA through to the Big Bang and how fusion works or quantum theory. And you might say well that's all irrelevant to me. I'm not interested in that. He will use the idea artificially constructed thought experiments like if your friend asks you if there's water in the fridge and you say yes and they go off to the fridge and they find nothing there but an eggplant you're entitled to say something to the effect of well I wasn't lying to you was I? Because language is always ambiguous. I mean if that's the best you've got to explain the significance of this nebulosity meaning this stuff I don't know what to say to you. It's not a particularly deep insight. Nor is it uplifting and optimistic that doesn't tell me how science works or mathematics. It doesn't help me to think more critically and creatively. It doesn't help me to inspire people who are new to this with how they are significant in the cosmic scheme of things.

Why it is that we've had a ratcheting up of progress recently. Why we should defend things like free speech free trade and democracy. How we can expect to perhaps have longevity and possible immortality. All of this is the inspiring vision that comes with the ideas associated with Karl Popper. The ideas that are being rejected here but where we're being offered nothing as an alternative. Nothing as a substantive alternative. I'll skip a little bit and I'll just read this paragraph. You get this is something else that passes for critique. Quote What would it be to see the world as partially pulled apart that is making room for pluralism error autonomy individuality and heterogeneity and as partially put together making room for normativity communion humility and transcendence end quote. This is again it's Kamala Harris's

word salad. It's I don't I don't understand that's actually I'm sorry I apologize that's not the author themselves they're quoting one of their favorite writers who is Brian Cantor Smith writes about transcending this metaphysical frame. So the author likes word salad writing that long word after long word after long word postmodern relativist guff the grey goo of what passes for tertiary education and the kind of stuff you get in graduate philosophy seminars that you get in these days. Heterogeneity normativity communion okay so I won't continue this has been over two hours now so I would just implore the listener or the viewer to go to the

the piece that is there on Substack oh I must mention as I'm just passing through the author says that there are obvious truths so let me just quote a bit he says quote I also think there are obvious truths in the realm of science like the claim the earth is not flat that your body is made of cells and that everyday objects follow predictable laws of motion end quote so are the laws of motion predictable or do you mean the paths that they follow enable you to make predictions that's already ambiguous is that a true statement as for the the earth is not flat it's an obviously true statement but again you cannot speak in such a way as to not be misunderstood just that claim the earth is not flat obviously true what if what if that

was something that was being said by a surveyor to another surveyor working on a bowling green and they've laid the soil and and one of them says the earth is not flat and the other one says no the earth is flat they're talking about the whole planet they're talking about that earth there on the bowling green and one of them is insisting the earth is flat and eventually the other one agrees the earth is flat and they both walk away saying it's wonderful the earth is flat because that's what they've been trying for all day to get the spirit level to ensure that the earth that's there is perfectly flat that the soil has no bumps and no curves the earth is flat this is what we mean by there are no obvious truths you don't know the context now you could you could build up a whole context and say well

### 2h 5m

there are these two astronomers sitting in a room and they're talking about the earth being flat or not it's an obvious truth the earth is flat I can imagine all sorts of scenarios where it doesn't matter how precise you try and make your thought experiment that I can say it's not obvious I could say the kicker in the tail is that those two astronomers were actors insisting the earth is not flat although the earth is flat now David Deutsch points this out you know the story of the the pope speaking ex cathedra and he says something that's supposed to be true but what if it was a rehearsal what if you yourself saw the pope saying a particular thing maybe saying the earth is flat maybe the pope is there saying the earth is flat and if you as a good catholic insist on believing everything the church or the pope says while he's sitting there in the throne the throne room of the the vatican and you hear him say it

### 2h 6m

do you walk away assuming the earth is flat because you heard the pope say it whenever the pope speaks ex cathedra from the from the throne well what if what if what if the pope was just rehearsing and what if the pope was having a good giggle once you walked out of the room because he knew he wasn't actually speaking ex cathedra at that point there are no obvious truths I remember and again this is hugely controversial one that goes around the internet now and again you know the one plus one equals two thing or two plus two equals four thing and you know there are a lot of woke academics saying well it's not always the case that two plus two equals four you know things are more complicated but one plus one equals two is a truth that you can come to understand more deeply so how obvious is it well it's not obvious to little kids who are first learning to do arithmetic for example it takes time to learn that so obvious to who is a question there are no obvious truths but more than that again university doing logic and computation following Pino's axioms

### 2h 7m

I used to have it hanging up in the background I don't have it anymore it's one of the earlier many years ago when I first started the podcast I would have the one A4 page proof that one plus one equals two was there somewhere you can do that starting with Pino's axiom so in what sense is that obvious what do those symbols mean when you write down one plus one equals two saying the earth is flat obviously true what if you don't speak English and you hear the earth is flat okay so let's just just check the last few things if there's anything else worth reacting to here oh this is a funny bit where he really leaves the rails

I think quote the author writes there is one other aspect of the Deutchian frame that Popper and Deutch never seriously question and it's that the correct way to think about how we obtain knowledge of the world is through the lens of formal logic the title of Popper's first book is a logic of scientific discovery it was specifically after a logic of science and that quest has been continued by Deutch the critical rationalists think about science in the frame of forming logical statements and figuring out the truth or falsity of those statements end quote so far wide of the mark in a number of ways firstly the author of this piece claims to have listened to the lecture that David Deutch gave where he provided a theory of truth and falsity where he specifically says and the author claims to have watched and listened with his own ears David talk about how truth and falsity are properties

of propositions not statements which are at best approximations to statements so how could he then also say that David Deutch thinks that science is about forming logical statements and figuring out the truth or falsity of those statements no he doesn't he doesn't even think statements strictly speaking in a formal sense have truth or false values they're properties of propositions so wrong about that but moreover no one has ever said certainly not popper did he only read the author of this only read the title of the book a logic of scientific discovery the point there was when he says logic of scientific discovery it doesn't mean he is a formal logical proof of how science is done no he says I'm not going to quote but the point of the book is when he used the word logic there it's like this is how science should be understood not this is the formal logic of science up until

the logic of scientific discovery people generally tended to think of science as being about verifying theories as true by gathering or accumulating more and more evidence and whether or not you think it's true or approximately true close to true more likely to be true whatever it was about trying to get to the final truth the logic that Popper was talking about is that we conjecture explanations and by a method of refutation if you really want to put it into logic modus tollens but never mind that if the experiment is predicted to have one outcome according to one explanation and a different outcome according to a different explanation the experiment that decides between them is a crucial test and that's the

other theory could not account for the other theory is falsified refuted now you might think that's trivial or whatever but that's the logic that's being talked about he's not saying that all of science is about logical proof quite the opposite there's no formal logic of science Popper has said and David has you know commented on this frequently and I've been making the same refrain which is Karl Popper doesn't even think there's a scientific method much less a logic you know like formal logic to the way in which science works you know he was a professor of scientific method but said you know I'm the only professor of

scientific method in the British Empire but he would tell his classes that he's here to tell them there is no such thing as a scientific method and okay it's just so long and misconceived this whole thing maybe I'll come back to it at some point but I think we've possibly exhausted my tolerance anyway for this the thing I will leave people with now because I really have to go and prepare for my talk with you Ron for more fun the central problem is that although ostensibly on the very superficial level this article appears to be a critique it's not a genuine critique because no alternative is offered what Karl Popper and David Deutsch have gifted to us in terms of what knowledge is information that solves a problem therefore is useful

tends to get itself copied has causal power etc all of that that vision of knowledge and how it grows and what people do and what their relationship to knowledge is and how knowledge and people give us the capacity to have power over physical reality and to generate wealth which is what is required in order to transform physical reality all of that stuff this author may say these are all tortured rationalizations trivialities and so on you can say all that you can have all that but they're not genuine criticisms because you're not actually saying how and why the view that is being offered by Popper and Deutsch is wrong because you don't have any alternative to offer I hear no alternative I read no alternative and as

he says that in the long run Karl Popper and David Deutsch will have been ignored will be ignored and will continue to be ignored all I can say the positive spin on that I would prefer that it wasn't I'd prefer that it wasn't I'd prefer that the idea spread far and wide that people would be more optimistic that people would be less inclined to believe prophets and pessimists and doomers that people would understand that they are the most important entities in physical reality a person error correcting their way to a better world able to generate wealth and be the flames of the enlightenment to spread freedom good ideas I'd like it if more people took that on but if if I wanted to put a positive spin on the alternative that Popper and Deutsch will continue to be ignored and become footnotes all I can say to people now is good good

because it means that if you understand Karl Popper and David Deutsch if you are a proponent of optimism unbounded progress knowledge creation and problem solving then you have an advantage not merely philosophically and in terms of wealth creation or whatever else but psychologically you'll be more balanced you'll enjoy things more because you appreciate that you are in possession of something that in this author's view is not going to be taken up by very many people so you're in a minority and being in a minority about just about anything so long as it's true and it is true it's a good explanation there couldn't be anything better than that except if everyone in the world of course also took on the ideas of Karl Popper and David Deutsch and became optimists and understood that whatever
