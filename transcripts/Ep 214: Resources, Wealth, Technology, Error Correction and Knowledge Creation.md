Welcome to TopCast. Resources, wealth, technology, error correction, and knowledge creation. Well, I've set myself quite a high bar there of linking these concepts together. But long-time listeners to TopCast will understand already how it is that these concepts are logically connected. Let's take seriously for a moment a link I first saw made in the beginning of Infinity. By David Deutsch. A link made between epistemology and morality. That link is, do not destroy the means of error correction. It is a moral claim. Do not do this thing. And it is an epistemological claim. It is about the means of error correction. What is error correction really? It is knowledge creation. It is improving ideas. Making rapid progress. The faster we can correct our errors, the more rapid our progress.

### 1m

And this is key, the faster wealth is generated. And recall what wealth is. It is the repertoire of physical transformations we are capable of causing. So an individual is wealthy to the extent they can transform physical reality around them. To construct homes or businesses. To make their lives more comfortable, fun. And even more so, to make their lives more comfortable, fun. To buy more technology and provide for their families. And get medical treatments. You know what it means to be wealthy. It is not merely money in a bank. It is all the capital one might control. Shares in businesses and property owned. And that's for an individual. And by the way, this is why claiming someone like Elon Musk should pay more tax. Because he has hundreds of billions of dollars makes no sense. You can't just tax his hundreds of billions of dollars. He doesn't have hundreds of billions of dollars in a bank.

### 2m

That's not his income. That's not what it means. Wealth is not money in a bank. It's not the cash he has on hand. The amount of currency. Most of his wealth is tied up in the share of companies he owns. To have him pay tax on all the shares he owns in the way people pay income tax would cause him to need to sell the shares he owns and that would cause the share price to plummet. That's called liquidation. Selling off non-cash assets to make cash. So when we talk about wealth, we're not talking about liquid assets. Liquid meaning easy to flow from one kind of asset into another. Cash in other words, or money in a bank. What we mean by wealth is what you are in principle capable of doing. Capable of transforming. So when it comes to an entire civilization, we want to be able to transform. Transform the world around us.

### 3m

And rapidly. We want to be, in other words, powerful. If the asteroid is heading towards us, our capacity to stop it literally depends on firstly, knowing how, so how much we know, what knowledge we have created about how to do so. And secondly, our ability to do what we know needs to be done. That's wealth. Our ability to transform matter into, say, a rocket which travels to the asteroid, and which can divert its course. The exact same is true of any potential disaster. Our ability to mitigate earthquakes and tsunamis depends upon us transforming matter into buildings and other structures that can resist earthquakes and tsunamis. And so too with climate change. We need to be as wealthy as possible to mitigate the effects of climate change, and to do so rapidly. We cannot avoid climate change. We can only deal with it. Because if we completely stopped anthropomorphic climate change,

### 4m

man-made climate change, we would not stop climate change. Climate change happens anyway. It happens because the climate changes. It always has and always will, unless we do something about it. But we do not know how to simply stop it. We cannot stop volcanoes erupting or the sun varying its output. Nor could we stop the shift of the Earth's orbit or its axis tilt. These things, we have no clue how to stop. So the climate will change in the same way it has gradually changed due to those things since the Earth itself formed. When there was no oxygen and lots of carbon dioxide, then a proliferation of photosynthesis once early plant life appeared, and then high heat and carbon dioxide during the time of the dinosaurs, and, well, just constant climate change long before people ever got there. and, well, just constant climate change long before people ever got there. and, well, just constant climate change long before people ever got there. and, well, just constant climate change long before people ever got there. and, well, just constant climate change long before people ever got there. And now that we are here, we have to deal with climate change,

### 5m

and earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, floods, other natural disasters, asteroids, solar flares, virus outbreaks, all of the natural disasters that come with simply existing in this universe on this planet. And to deal with it all, we need wealth, the set of things we know how to do in principle and have the physical capability to achieve in practice. and have the physical capability to achieve in practice. and have the physical capability to achieve in practice. So, I think I've made the case for rapid wealth creation in general. But here I want to focus in particular on climate change, given it happens, and regardless of how it happens, it doesn't matter. We'll come to that. The fact is, it's happening. Sea levels are rising in some places, but even if they're not, we know, for example, that there are such things as tidal surges. Those happen in places I know well, like Queensland, Australia, in a place like Harvey Bay. Tidal surges there, or storm surges as they're sometimes called,

### 6m

are sea level rises, but on a very rapid time scale due to, well, no surprise, a storm. So what do they do about such a thing to protect homes or entire cities? They build a wall, a seawall, and it protects against the literal ocean inundating human structures or anything in need of protection. All of New Orleans in the United States has a huge wall to protect it against exactly this, and it was that that failed during Hurricane Katrina, famously in 2005, causing the death of over 1,300 people. To build a seawall takes wealth. So if the seawalls can work, and they can work, Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5 hurricane, the most dangerous type, and the seawall wasn't sufficiently maintained, but if it was built better, the disaster would not have been so bad, killing so many people due to flooding. So in principle, it could have worked,

### 7m

and in practice it has worked at other times, and seawalls work around the world, and they can of course work over much longer time scales to mitigate sea level rises due to melting ice caps. And we might also want to mitigate against stronger storms. It's true that if the atmosphere heats up, and the oceans heat up, then there is more energy, and there's more energy for storms. So we need more wealth to strengthen our buildings against hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, and tornadoes, and floods. To build this stuff takes energy, and energy costs money. And to have ever more wealth, we need to build things as cheaply as we can so that they're effective, not at some exorbitant cost. Hence, we need fossil fuels. I said this in a live stream as much recently, but I'm going to repeat it here. Fossil fuels provide about 80% of global energy. Most of the rest comes from nuclear and hydroelectricity.

### 8m

3% comes from solar and wind. And those things are manufactured using fossil fuels. And of course, where those things, solar and wind, are used, they of course need to be supplemented by fossil fuels because the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind does not always blow. Now, I'm interested here in progress. I am focused on TopCast about knowledge creation. This is why it is partly happy coincidence and partly by design. I emphasize the KC here in some of my branding. KC. Knowledge Creation. It's the Theory of Knowledge Creation podcast. It's about knowledge creation. It always has been. That's what I focus on. The physics of it. The morality of it. The possibility of it. And here and now, what can fuel it? Literally fuel it. Because to create knowledge fast these days, we want two things.

### 9m

One, more people who know more and can create more. People are literally knowledge creators. And two, technology, which leverages knowledge creation and the capacity of people to transform the world. We want more compute, as people say. We want supercomputers. We want general computers to allow people to create all sorts of things and to model things to allow us to make legitimate predictions where we can and just do what we want. Better, faster, more efficiently and more cheaply. We want not only computers but transportation. We want cheap deliveries, cheap airline flights, cheap and long-distance car travel and trucks and buses and so on it goes. In principle, one day, sure, batteries might be able to do all this. But not now. And solar can't do it. And wind cannot do it, even in principle. And we'll get to why as I'll explain later. We have, as I've said before, something approaching an energy crisis in Australia.

### 10m

But then, so do many countries. This isn't hyperbole to say that pensioners, especially older people, the most vulnerable in our society, struggle to meet their energy costs, their electricity, gas, and heating bills. Now, many countries do. France does. Great Britain does. But why? Why are people literally dying of either the heat or the cold in both of those countries that I call out by name, France and Great Britain? Why are the energy costs so high there? Why should electricity costs in general in the West be so much higher than certain other places? I mean, let's just do a comparison. Here we go. The highest costs in the world are, well, look at that, Ireland and Italy, Belgium and the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, France and Australia.

### 11m

There we are inside the top ten. But why? Why should this be the case? Ireland, the home of peat, famously, which could in theory be used to generate electricity, but it's not. Those other countries there, why so high? Why the United Kingdom? The United Kingdom has lots of coal. They're not mining it. They're not mining it. Australia. Australia sits atop, as I say, some of the largest reserves of coal in the world. And we'll get to that. And yet we have among the highest electricity prices worldwide. This, as it says there, is the cost in US dollars per kilowatt hour. So near the top, we've got those countries that I mentioned. And then as we go down, the United States is somewhere near the middle. And then as we move towards the bottom, you have places like China, India and Russia in particular. Let's call them out by name. China is just so low there.

### 12m

India is low as well. They're equal. And Russia is lower still. Why is Australia so high? We should have among the cheapest electricity in the world because we sit atop vast reserves of coal. We sit atop vast reserves of natural resources. Why is any of this the case? Well, it's no accident. It's no accident that Australia has such high energy costs and China has such low energy costs. One of us, one of those countries has policies that cause them not to build more coal-fired power stations. And one is building coal-fired power stations at something like the rate of two coal-fired power stations per week. Per week. And Australia won't even build one more per year. And yet people hold up China as some sort of exemplar of renewable energy. As if they're building more solar farms and more wind power than anyone else on Earth

### 13m

and that we should follow in their footsteps. Well, is it the case? Well, yes they are. But they're also exporting a whole bunch of those solar panels and the wind farm technology to other countries. Causing them to impoverish their own citizens because in Australia we're paying a lot of money in order to use solar and wind while we export so much of our coal off to China. While refusing to use more of it at home in order to reduce the cost of our own electricity and energy production in general. But is China really an exemplar of renewable energy? Let's have a look. Most of their energy as we can see here is actually still generated by coal. The vast amount by coal. A lot of the rest is generated by hydro power. They have the largest hydroelectric plant in the world and they have lots of dams and lots of electricity is produced by hydroelectricity.

### 14m

It is a rounding error how much solar they're actually using. Yeah, sure they're building more and more solar farms but it is impossible it is impossible for them to replace what they produce in terms of electricity by coal by replacing it with solar and wind. You can see it here. It's impossible. They have among the cheapest electricity in the world because they keep on building more and more coal-fired power plants and coal is the cheapest form of energy that exists if you want to make lots and lots of electricity by boiling water and turning it into steam and spinning a turbine in order to generate electricity. Burning coal is the cheapest most cost-effective way of doing that. The fact that Australia has among the most expensive electricity in the world is particularly perverse as I like to say. Take a look at this table.

### 15m

This is very instructive. This tells us that Australia is third in the world in terms of coal reserves. We are willing to export it to the rest of the world but we keep precious little of it to ourselves. We refuse to burn more of it by building more coal-fired power stations in an attempt to save the planet. But while China doesn't have any compunction about building more and more coal-fired power stations and burning more and more coal contributing to global warming by adding more carbon dioxide into the planet we think that we can do something about climate change by being some sort of example to the rest of the world by virtue signalling. Virtue signalling by being able to say we're not building any more coal-fired power stations. But it does absolutely nothing to prevent climate change. We're told by our governments and we're told by intellectual class and by academics and by media that we're actually achieving something by not building any more coal-fired power stations.

### 16m

All we're doing is impoverishing our own businesses impoverishing in particular our citizens we won't build any more coal-fired power stations. But we have among the highest reserves of coal on the planet. But I've also explained this before elsewhere. The fact that we're number three is also questionable. It could be that we're actually even higher than this. These are known reserves of coal also called proven reserves of coal. The known reserves rest upon well, what has been explored by our exploration geophysicists. And we don't have that many exploration geophysicists in Australia in comparison to the United States. We're roughly the same area as the United States. The United States is a little bit bigger. But what is known to be beneath the surface of our country depends upon whether or not it's been explored. And how do you explore what's beneath the surface? Well, you need geophysical techniques in order to probe what's beneath the surface

### 17m

in the same way that a radiologist will take an x-ray and be able to probe what's inside your body. The U.S. has been scanned, so to speak, by the geophysicists over and again to find lots and lots of coal. So they have lots of proven reserves. Unlike Australia, we're only small parts of the continent of Australia, the country of Australia, the nation of Australia, where we are in fact the only country on Earth that's also a continent. So we're vast and we're of extremely low density unlike the United States. So therefore we are highly unexplored when it comes to what's beneath the surface. I once trained as a geophysicist. I never actually practiced geophysics at all. But I went to university for a while. I thought I might have wanted to go into the resource sector because it was burgeoning at the time in Australia. It kind of is again now. But for a while there, there was a downturn. And that happened just after I sort of began studying geophysics. Anyway, that's beside the point. I wanted to do exploration geophysics.

### 18m

There's all sorts of other kinds of geophysics. In particular, there's environmental geophysics. They look at things like groundwater, for example, and whether or not it might get polluted. There's academic geophysicists, theoretical geophysicists who look at the entire Earth, the whole Earth. And they use things like earthquakes to determine what the structure of the whole Earth is. That's why we know, for example, that the inner core of the Earth is solid. The outer core of the Earth is liquid metal. That's the thing that causes the magnetic field of the Earth. And then you have the mantle and then you have the crust. And the reason why we know all this is because of the academic whole-Earth geophysicists. So they're kind of theoretical. They also develop the techniques that the more applied geophysicists happen to use. So exploration geophysicists that work for resource companies and oil and gas companies, for example, in order to find the stuff that is beneath the surface without actually digging, because digging costs a lot of money.

### 19m

And so what you do is you can use something akin to an earthquake. The reason why you use an earthquake to determine what's inside the Earth is because, well, there's earthquake waves. And as they pass through the Earth, you can use seismometers to detect the refraction and reflection of the earthquake waves to figure out what is going on inside the Earth, what the structure of the Earth is as the shock waves pass through the Earth. What you can do is artificially create small-scale earthquakes by setting off explosions. And when you set off the explosions, you can use seismometers to detect what the structure of the Earth is, and therefore, without digging, you can find out whether or not there's a cavity in the Earth, whether or not there's a coal deposit in the Earth, whether or not there's oil down there. All that sort of stuff can be done. So that's called reflection or refraction seismology. There's also gravity techniques, which I've talked about on TopCast many times before. You use a literal gravimeter, this very heavy device that you put down on the ground

### 20m

and you measure the value of the gravity, 9.81 and then a number of other decimal places after that, which subtly changes as you move the gravity meter from place to place. You usually pick this thing up and move it about 10 metres and you plonk it down again, you take another reading, you pick it up and you move it around along a grid-type area and then you get this map of the value of gravity across a large area of land. And then you have to correct. That's a nightmare, trying to correct for things like if there are mountains, what is nearby, what the moon might be doing at a particular time. There's all sorts of corrections you need to make to the value of gravity that you have. And once you've done all this, you have a map of the value of gravity across an area of land that can determine what the subsurface is. It's actually kind of fun to do. There's that. There's also resistivity techniques where you measure the resistance of what's beneath the ground as well. You can use magnetic techniques.

### 21m

So there's all these sorts of really cool techniques that you learn about if you train as a geophysicist. And I also mentioned that there's the environmental geophysicist that can figure out stuff like, well, is there groundwater? And groundwater means water that's under the ground. And we have a lot of that in Australia, like, for example, the so-called Great Artesian Basin. Although Australia is a desert, we have this underground water that is sometimes used for irrigation. And so there is a tension between the miners, the resource companies, and the farmers who work in agriculture, quite obviously, who want to water their crops and water their animals as well in order to produce the food that keeps the nation fed and then, of course, to export our Wagyu beef and all of our crops around the world to make Australia money, versus the miners who want to do things like fracking. What fracking is is where you

### 22m

put explosives in the ground and fracture the sedimentary rock to release natural gas. But in doing so, you can also release chemicals into the groundwater. And that can kind of poison the water and so it's much more difficult to then use it for watering of crops and to give to your livestock and that kind of thing. So the government has to get involved. This is a legitimate use of government. People say you can do away with government, but how do you decide, how do you arbitrate between farmers and resource companies? It can be very difficult to reach agreement on these things. And so people have to go to court, but usually it's the government that decides what they're going to use particular land for. Is the land going to be used for resources? Are you going to dig it up? Or are you going to use it for agriculture? And also, in particular, are you going to do fracking,

### 23m

which can infect the groundwater? So anyway, I mention all that stuff about geophysics in particular because Australia has not been as well explored as the United States. When you look at the geological maps of the United States, they are done to high fidelity, high accuracy. You know what is beneath the surface in all parts of the United States. But in Australia, there's large parts that are not explored to that level of fidelity. So our so-called proven reserves, are not as high as somewhere like the United States. I'm, of course, a Popperian, so to me, proven simply means known. It's an estimate because, well, we haven't explored everything, as I say. And what we do have, we tend to export vast amounts of it. And this is why we are so wealthy as a nation. And yet, sometimes the citizens themselves are not particularly wealthy. They can still be taxed high. But the resource companies,

### 24m

well, they are taxed extremely high. And so a place like Western Australia, the state of Western Australia, which is the largest state in all of Australia, has a vast amount of money because of, in particular, mining companies like Hancock Prospecting, which is run by Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart. Our richest person is a woman, which is unusual for around the world. Often the richest person is not a female, but in Australia it happens to be. And she is, of course, demonized by large numbers of people in Australia, particularly on the left-leaning side of politics and in government in particular. They always want to cast her as some sort of awful person. But in fact, she does a lot of great things for Australia. And to her credit, recently she's been making some wonderful advertisements, these advertisements about the benefits of resources to Australia. Finally, we have people standing up in Australia and saying, this is what our company does. This is what our company does for the nation of Australia.

### 25m

That all the taxes that her company in particular pays fund things like teachers she mentions and nurses she mentions that work for government, in particular in Western Australia, contributing about a third or I think it's a quarter or a third of something like the entire revenue of that state. Hi, I'm Gina Rinehart, very proud patron of four of our Olympic team sports. Perhaps better known for my role in Hancock and Hancock agriculture. Years of dedication, training and hard work are required to become an Olympic athlete. Mrs Rinehart and the dedicated team at Hancock Prospecting have also been working hard for years to build Australia's most successful private company. And they've done it ever. Hancock's contribution in taxes and royalties

### 26m

over the past five years has exceeded $14 billion, sufficient to fund more than 30,000 nurses each year. And so there's that. But of course, she provides vast amounts of resources to the world, to the world as well as to Australia. So she does mining of all sorts of resources. Australia is like a huge mine that provides minerals and provides fuel that powers the world, in large part other countries around the world, in particular China. And that's what is sometimes perverse. We do export lots of our uranium and lots of our coal to parts of Europe, but in particular to China. And it's kind of perverse because we're fuelling our strategic enemy, China, and even our economic enemy to some extent. They punish us with things like tariffs, they punish us sometimes by stopping imports of our beef,

### 27m

so they stop us exporting beef to them now and again if we upset them in some way, or wine. They still just punish our companies, and they did that recently. And so it's not like the government of China is particularly friendly. And yet, we will still send them lots and lots of coal while refusing to use it ourselves. So it's bizarre. We kind of impoverish ourselves while enriching China, and then allowing them to do all these nasty things to us, like threaten our national security and threaten our own allies. Places like Taiwan, where they send their Coast Guard in and have little mini battles between their Coast Guard and the Taiwanese Coast Guard, despite our protestations and the protesting of the United States. So anyway, it just seems perverse to any onlooker, someone like me, who sees what's going on with China, and also sees this bizarre thing we have about sending lots and lots of cheap energy to China.

### 28m

So their people have lots and lots of cheap energy. Well, good on them, to a large extent. But our energy costs are extremely low, because although we're sitting right on top of all the coal that we're sending off to China, we pay a vast amount for electricity, when we could be paying next to nothing. Now, why would we be paying next to nothing? Now, why wouldn't we use coal? Well, obviously it's political, which is due to the environmental concerns, the anti-human concerns about valuing the environment over people. And so we choose to use instead, unlike China, things like coal and wind. We're prioritizing those, refusing to build more coal-fired power stations, despite the fact that, by any metric, more energy is going to come from coal and other fossil fuels, not to mention, of course, uranium.

### 29m

And it's very telling that the people who are presumably very interested in protecting the environment and preventing climate change also happen to be against uranium. So they're not really all about trying to reduce CO2, because if that was their primary concern, then, of course, what they would be doing is trying to build nuclear reactors, because they produce almost no carbon dioxide. There's a bit generated in the mining of the uranium, the refining of the ore, the pitchblende ore, and, of course, the construction of the nuclear reactors themselves. But they're not interested in doing that. They want solar and wind. But even then, the real hardcore environmentalists, of course, aren't even about solar and wind. They don't like the mining of the minerals that solar and wind power actually requires. Now, if you want to compare

### 30m

different kinds of fuels for generating electricity, or just different kinds of ways in which to generate electricity, one standard way of doing this is to look at the energy density of fuels. And so we can talk about the energy density of things like, for example, coal. And coal has an energy density of something like 26 to 33 megajoules per kilogram. So 26 million joules every kilogram. Something like that. That's for coal. Something like plain old wood, if you were to burn wood, is significantly less than that. It's about 18 megajoules per kilogram. Then you move to something like natural gas, and it's like, 54 megajoules per kilogram. Gasoline, 46 megajoules per kilogram, which is roughly the same as something like diesel or even jet fuel.

### 31m

They're all about the same. So we're talking about, you know, over the order of 40, 50 megajoules per kilogram. Now you move to something like a nuclear reactor, and it's completely different. You're looking at orders of magnitude difference. So something like uranium, instead of being of the order of 40 to 50, if you're lucky, something like that, megajoules per kilogram, you're talking about in the case of uranium for a fission reaction, 80 million or 81 million megajoules per kilogram. That's ridiculously high. Now, of course, uranium takes a lot more energy to get out of the ground. You're going to have to refine the pitch blend or whatever rock you have to be extracting the uranium from. That's going to take a lot of energy. However, of course, you're producing all of that energy from your nuclear reactor. So it's easily worth it in the long run.

### 32m

Now you compare that to something like a fusion reactor, you know, the theoretical fusion reaction. And you're looking at, instead of 80 million megajoules per kilogram, in the case of fission, so if you move to something like a fusion reactor, a theoretical fusion reactor, we don't have one yet, but if you were able to do a fusion reaction, then you're looking at something like 640 million megajoules per kilogram. So that's crazy. That's crazy in comparison. Now, in theory, the perfect reaction, the perfect conversion of, matter to energy, would be an annihilation reaction. So where you take antimatter and you combine it with matter, and then you get perfect conversion of the matter into energy, which is what Star Trek used

### 33m

in order to power their vehicles, was the antimatter annihilation reaction. Well then, that would give you something like 90 trillion, 90 trillion megajoules per kilogram. Okay? 89 trillion, 875 million, 517 thousand, 874 megajoules per kilogram. Or 90 petajoules per kilogram. So, anyway, the point is that you're getting a lot more from a nuclear reaction than you're getting from a chemical reaction like the burning of coal. And then you have to compare those things to something like wind and solar. And it makes no sense to try and talk about wind and solar in those terms because you're not burning anything. So there's no such thing as a number of joules per kilogram because there's no such thing as a kilogram of solar energy. There's no such thing as a kilogram of wind power.

### 34m

So, how do we possibly compare the burning of fossil fuels or a nuclear reaction to something like solar and wind? Well, you have to talk about energy concentration, something like that. Or better yet, and as I tried to talk about in my live stream on this, the only way really to do this is to talk about the number of joules per meter squared per second that you're getting, the watts per meter squared that you're getting. And this is, again, a difficult comparison to make. But if you do try to do this comparison, and you look at the footprint, let's say, of the size of a solar plant, so taking into account the entire area taken up and the amount of joules that you get per meter squared of the solar plant, or of the wind plant,

### 35m

which is spread over a huge area, compared to the area taken up by a coal-fired power station or a nuclear power station, then that's a comparison you kind of can make. But even then, it's not really valid, but you're looking at something of the order, taking into account the efficiency of the solar panels and things like the fact that the solar panels are not going to be able to generate electricity at night. They're also not going to be able to generate much electricity as the sun passes overhead as it begins to set or as it rises in the morning or when the clouds go over. Or at certain times of the year when the sun is lower on the horizon, for example in winter in many places. Taking all of that into account, then you're looking at something like five watts per meter squared, something like that, when it comes to solar and even wind,

### 36m

which is much, much less than what you would get from solar, given the fact, and we will come to this shortly, that the solar constant is about 1,300 something like that watts per meter squared. That's the amount of energy that is coming from the sun, which is fixed, but we'll talk about why that changes. But anyway, for a solar plant, you're only getting about five watts per meter squared, taking into account all of those constraints that I've talked about before, as compared to about 300 watts per meter squared, something like that, for the coal-fired power station. A bit more than that for the nuclear. That's the only way you can sort of do these comparisons, is the number of watts per meter squared. But it's a difficult comparison to make. I talk about this in more detail in my livestream. Just a little supplementary here, so that we've got some idea of the calculations that I used in order to

### 37m

come up with these numbers. Originally, I was going to just ask ChatGPT what the approach was to calculate the approximate energy density comparisons between fossil fuels and renewables happened to be, knowing that it's not a straightforward thing. This is the kind of thing that is done in high schools these days, calculating energy densities and comparing different energy sources. So I know how to do this, but I thought, hey, I'm lazy, I'll get ChatGPT to do it. But no matter what way I phrased the question, it always ended up producing some ridiculous answer where solar and wind had more energy per unit area than coal did or uranium. And it made no sense. And it wasn't until I dug into the calculations that I figured what it seemed to be doing, especially in the case of, let's say, solar, was looking at an individual panel and presuming at peak time an individual panel would be putting out, you know, anything up to like 300 watts

### 38m

per meter squared of energy. That, of course, is under ideal conditions, which is not a fair comparison. What we want is an approximate average output of the entire power station. And the entire power station has a certain footprint. It takes up a certain amount of area. So by constructing this question, eventually, after many trials, I came up with something more sensible. So here's the question. Taking into account the size, area, plant, all of the surrounding land taken up by the solar plant and comparing this in a similar way to wind and accounting for night time and the average output over 24 hours of a solar panel, compare the energy density per square meter of solar plants, wind plants, coal-fired plants and nuclear plants. And now we get something more straightforward. Now I'm not going to go through the calculations for you. You can see them. They're up there on your screen. Let's just skip to the summary, which is a solar power plant, you're going to get about 5 watts per meter squared, as I say.

### 39m

Wind is even less, 0.87 watts per meter squared. But, of course, this is unfair because, obviously, a wind power plant has vast areas where nothing is being done. It's just often ocean or land between one wind farm and the next. But if that land could otherwise be used for something else, agriculture, let's say, mining, let's say, tourism, let's say, there's a whole bunch of competing interests that people have, then is it economically viable? Does it make rational sense in economic terms to build these things? And you compare that, you know, 0.87 watts per meter squared to a coal-fired power station, which has got a very small footprint. You know, you fit the entire turbine and the burner and the cooling towers and all that sort of stuff and the car parks, presumably, into an area such that you get 300 watts per meter squared out of that coal-fired power plant. And nuclear, 417 watts per meter squared. In other words, for a tiny little area,

### 40m

a dot on a map, you are getting vast amounts of energy. So, you know, vast amounts of energy rather than having what many people consider an environmentally destroying technology to cut down habitats that could otherwise be used for a refuge for animals if that's what you happen to care about. That kind of thing. And again, I've got nothing against solar panels here, particularly in Australia. Large parts I've already mentioned here are a desert. Ideal for having lots and lots of energy in the environment. You've got a lot of energy in the air and it's very important to have a lot of energy in the air and in the air to keep the energy going. So, you've got a lot of energy in the air and you've got a lot of energy in the air and you've also got transmission

### 41m

line issues. They cost money of energy densities of renewables versus fossil fuels and nuclear. So, as I've already said time and time again so far in this particular podcast, the reason why we have among the highest electricity costs in the world is because we refuse to build more coal-fired power stations even when our demand outstrips supply. Supply that is more coal-fired power stations but we refuse to build them so the costs go up as we literally run out of electricity especially in summer when the air conditioning uses go up. So, our only solution to this appears to be on the left side of politics is to insist on using more and more solar and wind even though they've not been built yet the solar plants and the wind farm

### 42m

so-called wind factories haven't actually been built yet but we're going to double down on building more and more of these things even though the supply isn't there. On the conservative side of politics the only solution appears to be that they're offering now is not to build more coal-fired power stations as I've argued so far here but it's to build nuclear. Now, I've got nothing against nuclear and I can come back to that soon but if you're really, really optimistic maybe it's going to be five years but you can build a coal-fired power station in a couple of years something like that and you could build one every single year and it's not going to cost you that much. As I say those most animated about climate change are also against nuclear. This indicates it's not really about the environment as I've already said or global warming or concerned over CO2 it's just anti-technology

### 43m

anti-progress anti-posturing. They, the people who are all against fossil fuels just find the idea of human flourishing disgusting but ignoring all this for now Australia should build nuclear plants and they should start doing that immediately but the lead time as I've said is something like 10 years so in the meantime they should be building coal-fired power stations build coal for the pensioners and just to help our economy make us all more wealthy but no they're not going to do that they're going to impoverish our own country for environmental reasons like climate change and that's going to make zero difference overall to climate change the fact that we here in Australia don't build any more coal-fired power stations because as I say and as the statistics show and you can easily look this up just Google it as people say you can find

### 44m

China builds two new coal-fired power stations every single week two every week and we will not even build one more per year China are responsible for 95% of new coal power production so what is going on in the world it's not a conspiracy it's simply fact the West is impoverishing itself while China is enriching themselves both economically and militarily the military needs to be powered by the cheapest most efficient kinds of energy China doesn't care about climate change they might pretend to but that is also a strategy they have it's a military and political strategy they have to pretend to the world they care about climate change by acting as if they're building

### 45m

the world you should build more renewable stuff and then to sell us to sell us lots and lots of solar panels and so they can say and the left says look China builds more solar power than anyone else but it's still tiny in comparison to their coal output as I've already shown you the graph let's put it up again here we go they're held up as this beacon as I say of green energy sixth in the world for solar energy by the way we're ahead of Spain we're ahead of the UK we're ahead of France and Brazil big economies and yet our own politicians are saying we need to do more we still need to do more we still need to impoverish ourselves even more and to produce more solar and to build more solar plants but we don't have time we don't have we honestly don't have time to worry about building more solar plants given that our people are

### 46m

given that our population is suffering when it comes to literal cost of energy a second interlude here as so very often people can agree on what the problems are here among other things the Prime Minister of Australia this year 2024 agrees that the cost of electricity is adding to the cost of living and people are suffering in this country in this world country however although the problems can be agreed upon and seen by all solutions are far more elusive their solution is to redistribute money from one area of the economy the mining area for example and give it to people who pay household electricity bills and so we are being offered a credit on our electricity bill as if it's a gift

### 47m

one might think a bribe in order to help us pay the exorbitant cost of electricity that we do pay here and this is only being done over the course of a couple of years and every single quarter your electricity bill is reduced by a tiny amount and so this appears as if it is a gift from the government of course government has no money government has to tax the money and give it back not directly to you but to the power companies who then add it onto your bill as a deduction in your bill this is their solution adding in multiple middle men to the entire scheme of things rather than as I keep saying building more coal-fired power stations which would deliver cheap energy into the grid lowering barely anything rounding errors

### 48m

essentially to the global warming problem because China is already building two coal-fired power stations every single week so here Anthony Albanese our prime minister in 2024 is helping with the cost of living he recognises the problem but suggesting that the best way to do this is via economic redistribution a grant to your power bill all couched in the terms of as they like to say sustainable economic growth sustainable economic growth right there now of course what do we mean by sustainable economic growth well growth that doesn't happen too fast they're not interested in growth they don't care about the footprint of industrialisation

### 49m

happening too fast it's all seen as a terrible evil and so it says here specifically within the context of sustainable economic growth this budget that they have provides a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer and new help with energy bills the new help with energy bills means the tax that you do pay is going to be given back to you in part on your energy bill even more rather than handing it back to you via energy bill because then it appears as if it is a gift from the government so who doesn't want to vote for a government who's giving you money off your electricity bills you don't tend to notice the money that disappears from your paycheck people don't mind that people don't notice that if they are just paying their income tax as a matter of course as their employer takes the tax out which is what happens for the government but it certainly is every single week

### 50m

month or fortnight whenever people normally get paid uranium could solve part of this but we also don't have time for that green power is not going to help because of energy density as I've already been through as I say I used to teach this stuff the students understood it on the one hand well they were young people and so given they were young people they understood it from all their other teachers and I wasn't a good enough teacher to sway them on many of these issues towards more common sense ideas except I could use your Ron Brook and in particular pulling on their heartstrings with a video like this let me show you this one we'll see if I don't get a copyright strike for this sit here in Europe in your cushy middle-class and you want to judge the African or let's take the Chinese

### 51m

because that's why you know in Apple or the Indonesian so-called sweatshop or whatever and you want to tell me that two bucks a day is not a dramatic improvement in their life it is and there's no way for them to get to the point to be as rich as you are unless they go through that phase and if you deny them they will pay for and therefore they withdraw completely from the market because you know what I'm not paying 600 bucks for this I'll pay 300 and if I stop buying this who suffers that Chinese kid who's right now making whatever three bucks a day or whatever right and he his alternative is to go back to the farm and you know what they did in the farms 40 years ago when the Chinese were all producing agriculture they were dying of starvation and the Chinese died of starvation under Mao suddenly you've given them opportunity to actually attain

### 52m

middle class to learn a skill to make to have a profession to make money to make themselves into something and by the way the Chinese never complain about how much they're being paid you guys complain we complain in the West because yes to our middle class comfy lives that seems ridiculous but that's because you've never lived in England has lived in real poverty the way the Chinese and the Africans and the Indonesians live when you go when you go to a place and it's interesting because take take Korea Korea is an interesting case study right you've got North Korea and South Korea 50 60 70 years ago South Korea was as poor as North Korea they were both dirt poor and then South Korea instituted some economic freedom and it made it possible for people to go and work for a buck a day for two bucks a day and they developed skills and they increased their productivity and they started building more stuff and capital

### 53m

flu came in and increased their productivity even more and suddenly and you go to Seoul today and they're as rich as you are but they in in 70 years they did or 60 years they did what you've done in in hundreds of years how did they do it because of the ability to slowly ratchet up now if you demand that they skip and get to your standard of living like that then they will stay poor forever and that's what you're condemning them to you're condemning them to eternal poverty a kid who is getting a buck or two a day his alternative is to die in the fields you make giving it doing him a favor by giving him the two bucks a day and he's producing something and he's learning a skill at the same time and one day he'll run the factory but if you you demand that he gets paid for he'll never have the job he'll never have the the factory he'll never have the factory and he'll stay poor for the rest of his life and all you have to do to see this in real action is go to Asia and see what they how they live under

### 54m

poverty and see how that these countries are growing rich and it you know do you know that over the last 30 years now this is not my statistic this is the United Nations you could look it up online right over the last 30 years a billion that's what a B pillion people have come out of poverty in Asia there's a billion people that have come out of poverty in the United States there's a billion people that have come out of Asia why because of capitalism not because of foreign aid foreign aid doesn't help anybody except the dictators who put them in the Swiss Bank account what helps poor countries is freedom you give them the rule of law you give them property rights if you're interested in property rights and how it helps poor people read capital ideas by Hernando de Soto a Peruvian economist a brilliant economist you give them property you give them capital you give them a job that's how you create wealth you give them a job that's how you create wealth not by not by giving them not by giving them handouts so a billion people have come out of poverty now I know some people have

### 55m

said all you guys care about is the rich somebody said what you care about is the rich deserve it you know what I don't care about the rich they don't need taking care of right they're doing great I care about the poor I care about the poor and the only system in human history the only system in human history to help the poor to help ambitious poor people to make a living people rise up of poverty and become rich has been capitalism free markets are the only only cure for poverty the only way in which you become rich so you don't have to have poor people is through capitalism that's how this country became rich that's how America became rich that's how Hong Kong became rich that's how South Korea became rich there's no other way to do it when we tried socialism we get poverty we get a return a deterioration we get a destruction of wealth we get poverty we get a return a deterioration we get a destruction of wealth we get a destruction of wealth not a creation of wealth so you want people to you care about the poor and the middle class I also care about the rich because I think that they are

### 56m

villainized for a which is unbelievably unjust now that that's a that's a fantastic video and I encourage you to watch the entire thing that did tend to sway them sway is the important word not completely convince them they didn't bent a little bit sometimes they'd get angry when when confronted with you know something like the work of your own Brooke on some of this and they'd get angry when I talked about the importance of fossil fuels and that kind of thing because they were indoctrinated heavily indoctrinated into environmentalism and social social causes socialism by other teachers and so me as the one lone teacher that was giving them something different from what they were giving to other teachers because they were indoctrinated heavily indoctrinated into environmentalism and social causes something counter ideology I seemed like a dogmatist in comparison yet it's understandable that young people are confused about this and resistant to the idea of fossil

fuels being a solution to many of our problems with wealth and helping people that are struggling with things like electricity prices and just poverty in general bringing wealth to poor nations and even wealth to people that are struggling with things like electricity prices and just poverty in general bringing wealth to poor nations and even wealth to people that are people in the west who are struggling to sort of make ends meet so to speak people think that solar can do more than what it possibly can we saw this recently and I'll play the clip here if I possibly can of Elon Musk explaining to Joe Rogan how solar cars work this is a lay person in Joe Rogan trying to understand what an expert in this area Elon Musk is trying to explain to Joe Rogan how solar cars work and he's trying to tell him Joe didn't get it sometimes the students struggled with this but my physics students they tend to understand it I happen to

### 58m

think that Elon Musk botches the explanation here let's hear what he has to say how far away are we if it's ever going to happen at all from having a vehicle that can operate entirely on solar well you've got a surface area thing it's about a kilowatt per square meter normal to the sun roughly really depends on what kind of mileage you get to keep the car going just from the car surface area if you had like something that folded out you could you could make it self-sustaining something that folded out so like you could park it and then leave it on yeah you'd have to like unfold like like the starling satellites do where you unfold the solar panels you just need more surface area is there any potential potential for an advancement in technology that would make a smaller area much better at conducting sun nothing uh no it's it's a kilowatt per square meter that's what you're going to get when the sun if you're if you're normal to the sun so 90 degrees to the sun and there's nothing that could accelerate that or no that's just literally the that's just it so it's not that he gets

### 59m

anything technically wrong there but he doesn't emphasize the key point and the key point is that above the atmosphere you get 1360 watts per meter squared from the sun so for every single meter squared that's how much energy you get from the sun and that's what you're going to get from the sun so that's what you're going to get from the sun so that's what you're going to get from the sun that's the energy per second you're getting from the sun 1300 joules every single second per meter squared that's what you're getting it's simply fixed by the luminosity of the sun the sun has a certain brightness a certain amount of power it's putting out in all directions and by the time you get to 150 million kilometers away which is where the earth happens to be that's how many watts per meter squared you're getting now the earth doesn't have a perfectly circular orbit sometimes it's slightly further away sometimes it's closer it's further away sometimes it's further away and further away during june it's closer during january and so that number does fluctuate it's on average 1361 but it goes as high as 1412 watts per meter

### 1h 0m

squared and as low as about 1321 but again all of that is above the atmosphere above the atmosphere of the earth that's what you're getting now below the atmosphere of the earth down on the ground it's much less than that because the atmosphere of the earth is very good at absorbing lots of the energy that's why we happen to put telescopes in space because you don't get much infrared penetrating the atmosphere of the earth it tends to get absorbed by water vapor that's in the air and by carbon dioxide that happens to be in the air that kind of thing so therefore we have infrared telescopes that are high up on mountains or indeed in space so that we can collect some of that energy that is getting absorbed by the atmosphere and so therefore if you have a telescope that is high up on mountains or indeed in space so that we can collect some of that energy that is being absorbed by the atmosphere and so therefore if you're interested in collecting energy from the sun with solar panels let's say then you're not getting all of the energy that's coming from the sun and so on a cloudless day under optimal conditions

### 1h 1m

the best you can hope for is not 1300 watts per meter squared but the best you can hope for the absolute best you can hope for at noon when a cloudless day is a thousand and twenty five watts per meter squared or if you even have slightly wispy clouds a series of clouds that are slightly wispy clouds that are slightly wispy clouds that are slightly wispy clouds that are slightly wispy clouds that are thicker clouds then you're getting about five hundred and fifty watts per meter squared you've gone all the way down to five hundred and fifty watts per meter squared for thicker clouds and the energy goes even lower than that still and of course you've got the issue of what happens when the sun begins to set and the sun is rising not to say at night time and all of that sort of stuff so these are under optimal conditions so as the students understood but what joe is failing to understand was that the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because

### 1h 2m

the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because the sun is rising because of your car there's not an area of your car to collect the energy in order to power the car that's just not the way any of this works and yet Joe in his mind was thinking and you can tell as Elon's telling him that he thinks that the limiting factor of what's going on here is the technology that if only you could make a solar panel better then you'd be able to collect yet more energy but there's a fixed amount of energy that's the whole point and that fixed amount of energy is about a thousand watts per meter squared something like that way too small an amount of energy to power something like a car and to do what you want there there are so-called

### 1h 3m

solar cars that get around and they look like this there's the world solar challenge that happens to go on in Australia and my old alma mater that I often reference here on the top cast people would get sick of me the University of New South Wales they enter a car every single year I've had students who went on to study photovoltaics at the University of New South Wales it's a wonderful degree program and in fact they do wonderful things like they actually send the students overseas to countries where they otherwise in certain villages don't have electricity and they install solar panels there this is great stuff this is a useful thing that solar panels can do they can be used to charge batteries in little villages that aren't connected to the grid that kind of thing but they also do this world solar challenge thing where they put solar panels on a car but of course the cars are tiny and they're really light and it only works during certain times of the day obviously when the sun is overhead and they do it no accident in the middle of Australia because heck it's really

### 1h 4m

really sunny in Australia and there are places and times where you don't have much in the way of clouds and you don't have and you have optimal conditions but there's not many places in the world that do have solar panels but the problem is that solar isn't very powerful it doesn't go very fast and all that sort of thing but what you can do and what lots of people do is put solar arrays on top of their houses and that's that's a reasonably good thing that you can do if you're going to afford it in Australia lots of people do have solar but the only reason lots of people have solar is because the government pays for the solar arrays on top of their roofs but the solar array the solar panels they cost many thousands of dollars and it might take many many years if an that the solar array the solar panels they cost many thousands of dollars and it might take many many years. perspective . I'll always go back to information for people. There's a lot. for the solar panels to pay themselves off and by then by the end of those many years well the solar panel needs repairs and maintenance and all that kind of thing so it's not just a one-off cost and eventually the solar panels do need to be replaced ultimately they do have a

### 1h 5m

lifetime have a finite lifetime but the government in australia offers anything up to seven thousand australian dollars that's brilliant if you happen to own a home they give you seven thousand up to seven thousand australian dollars which is what something like four thousand us dollars something like that which is brilliant if you happen to own a home and in fact that will tend to cover the entire cost of a small solar array and if you're a pensioner you can get your solar array essentially for free well not for free it's taxpayer funded and in general i don't begrudge you know especially old age pensioners for example who've paid taxes their entire life getting some of that money back but let's just admit what's going on the government is paying for these things using tax money and so often the tax money is coming from other people who have jobs and in fact might not even own homes all that kind of stuff is going on okay so i've gone on long

### 1h 6m

enough about solar i think the only reason that that solar is a big issue in a place like australia is because the left side of politics and the greens are pushing it but the greens we have to admit are less about being pro-environment and more these days about being anti-civilization anti-the west you know they're basically pro-hamas and anti-israel they're anti-technology and even the people that are just center-left are basically on board with lots and lots of the green policies even some of the conservatives ape their policies as well especially in places like the uk all of it wreaks a little bit of conspiracy when you look into it they're they're implementing the world economic forum the wef and the un globalist ideas their agenda and that sounds like a terrible conspiracy but the truth is these people do want to control what everyone else does and why well

### 1h 7m

who knows get people like klaus schwab and the other people in the world economic forum and well you know they're germans they come from that continental european philosophical tradition they want control they're already wealthy many of them have shares in green technology and it's they who accuse elon musk of conspiracy but they're the ones who are involved in a conspiracy but elon musk of course can't win one minute he's accused of being kind of pro-palestine and then you know someone like ben shapiro takes him to israel and he's accused of being pro-palestine and then you know someone being pro-israel and so he's accused of being involved in a conspiracy in either direction the man cannot win and in truth anyone who espouses something that is against the environmental consensus has difficulty winning they're accused of being involved in climate denial they're

### 1h 8m

accused of being shields for something like the fossil fuel industry that kind of thing accused of being paid you know it's All these sort of conspiratorial things. The fact is that the people who are on the side of the environmentalists, many of them come from a, what you might say, especially young people, come from a good place. They want to save the planet because they honestly think the world is ending. But they have been indoctrinated by people who hold honestly anti-human views. There exist in this world anti-human memes. We have to admit this. And they are a flavour of, in many cases, anti-rational memes. They hold themselves immune from criticism and they disable the capacity of people to actually criticise those particular ideas.

### 1h 9m

Because as soon as anyone tries to criticise these ideas, others will accuse them of being terrible people, immoral people, you know, uncaring about the environment, uncaring about others. Other people, uncaring about poverty-stricken people. When in fact it's quite the opposite. Many people who are pro-environment really support some sort of modern-day Gaia hypothesis. The idea that the Earth is literally alive and some sort of God, I suppose. They almost worship Gaia. It's Gaia worship. They, like following philosophers like Peter Singer, place any and all consciousness, equal to or even above humans. So they think that animals are equivalent to humans, morally equal to humans. They want to protect animals around the world more than they want to protect humans,

### 1h 10m

more than they want to make the planet liveable by people, by actual human beings. But the point is, and I've said this many, many times before, and I'm following in the great tradition of what we learn in the beginning, Infinity, about being properly pro-people, pro-human. The world is barely livable. Planet Earth is barely livable. Barely hospitable, barely survivable. We make it hospitable. We have to protect ourselves from the environment. It is not the environment that needs protection from us. It is precisely the other way around. We need protection from it in all its forms. From storms and droughts and floods through to cosmic forces in the form of asteroids and solar flares and everything in between. Climate change is in many ways the least of our concerns. It's happening very gradually, and civilization is not ending because of it.

### 1h 11m

What we are surrounded by is matter, rocks, and all of it utterly useless until we know what to do with it. A resource is, otherwise useless matter plus knowledge. It is we people who transform matter into resources. Indeed, in principle, we can, as David Deutsch writes in the beginning of Infinity, transform quote, anything into anything that the laws of nature allow end quote. What we need is to know how. In principle, one day we will be able to program a thing, an obedient universal constructor, to do this for us. We will still be needed to write the program. A person is always needed to figure out the recipe for converting one thing into another. For example, for transforming bauxite ore into aluminium, and then into parts of a jet aircraft, let's say.

### 1h 12m

But we are not there yet. We are always in a transition phase to a better world. And we need to be honest about where we are, while being optimistic about where we can, get to where we are is in a place where people need cheap electricity to power their devices, their homes, and in particular to lift people out of poverty. This allows them to escape much of their toil and one day, perhaps all of it so that they can live lives. They are actually destined for that. People are here to live for, and that is to create. That's what we're here for. Ultimately. And we do that by being free to correct errors in what we know. And that means we need to learn. So ubiquitous technology powered by cheap electricity and the mining of the solid earth, and soon perhaps asteroids for the materials to build what we need to make our lives better in the here and now.

### 1h 13m

And that means ultimately finding Planet B, which we already have. It's Mars. And as I said, back in 2021 right here I'm talking about the 452nd planet found by the Kepler Space Telescope and it was designated Planet B was the 452nd planet designated B. So there has been lots of Planet B's even though the catch cry, the mantra of the Extinction Rebellion people in the environmentalists is constantly there is no Planet B. There's lots of Planet B. The earth is a first step. We need to start treating it that way and exploit what we have while we're here to make it livable and hospitable and even comfortable. Certainly we should want to make it safer than it is,

### 1h 14m

and that takes fossil fuels. It takes literal fuel to provide the energy to manufacture the technology to leverage knowledge creation so that we have the wealth to continue the cycle of creating more knowledge to figure out how to turn more otherwise useless matter into resources and energy sources to fuel error correction and to make progress faster so we can solve the problems we are yet to encounter including the problem of how to make wealth ever faster because the problems really are coming that we do not yet know about and are not expecting interlude number three and i'm including this because two news items of note happened during the course of my putting this particular podcast together the first was this announcement to bring down the prices of all goods we will end the biden harris war on american energy and we will drill baby drill we're going to

### 1h 15m

start that day one that announcement was based upon something that i originally thought the governor of alaska during a vice presidential debate had once said famously that was sarah palin who was quoting in fact someone else another republican national convention member maryland lieutenant governor michael steel he was the one who first used the drill baby drill idea which taken more broadly is a call for using more fossil fuels whatever else you think of trump this is a good idea this will reduce energy costs this will not contribute to the downfall of civilization there is nothing wrong with reducing the cost of energy around the world again energy is the thing that fuels everything else including knowledge production that was the first thing

### 1h 16m

the other thing of note news item of note local to australia was that one of our other richest people happens to be andrew twiggy forest and just like gina reinhardt the richest person in australia he earns his money also from mining taking stuff out of the ground but he likes to cozy up to the politicians somewhat more than what miss reinhardt does so mrs reinhardt isn't particularly liked by the elite class but andrew twiggy forest is now why would that be one reason is twiggy forest is the richest person in australia and he's the only one that lives in australia that is average increase in poverty increase of poverty but he also sucks out money working in the industry and he makes up for this but he's also sucks a lot of money working in the industry and he's also sucks a lot of poverty and he's got a lot of money making money on his own but he also sucks a lot of money making money out of the government and so for those who don't know andrew twiggy forest invested heavily into a number of green projects rather like elon musk he wanted to corner the market on certain areas of environmental technologies in the case of twiggy forest it was so-called green hydrogen what is green hydrogen green hydrogen is an interesting sounding technology where you take something like wind or solar and

you use that to perform electrolysis on water generating therefore hydrogen which itself is a which itself is a concentration of energy and energy is something that we don't really get to form of energy. So it could and does in many places around the world fuel cars which use engines that burn hydrogen and out the exhaust comes water. So it's a wonderful fuel if you can get it. Most of the hydrogen that is used for this comes from fossil fuels so it's not green. So Twiggy Forrest argued if he could build enough solar panels and wind farms then it would be cost effective for him to electrolysize water and to store the hydrogen for use to power any number of vehicles or other devices. Many people invested. The government gave him great subsidies. It was all looking towards the good. Our environment minister, our entire government, the prime minister were all on board with Twiggy Forrest until this happened. The writing was on the wall when it came to green hydrogen. It just was not economically effective even with the backing of

the government. Even with the subsidies and so 700 people lost their jobs. The market speaks in the end. If it can't work in Australia it really isn't going to work anywhere for now because for now energy costs are already skyrocketing and this is even with fossil fuels but because we as I have emphasized throughout this entire podcast we continue to artificially inflate the price of fossil fuels by artificially reducing their supply in wealthy western countries we are going to find it difficult to persuade people to increase their power prices even more by tending in the direction of ever more renewables. We need to use more fossil fuels. We've been lucky so far but it's simply reality not pessimism to appreciate that the cosmos is a vast place and we have only

scratched the surface. In understanding it. So we need wealth. We need power to deal with the problems not yet encountered. So let's make ourselves as wealthy as we can as fast as we possibly can. We need to save ourselves not the environment and one key way to do this is to give people choice rather than foist solutions onto them. Let the market decide what energy sources people want to use. People like Sam Harris say that the market cannot solve something like climate change and for that reason we need regulation. We need to start foisting solutions onto people. We need an expert class to tell us all what to do because we cannot possibly come together and cooperate to create the solution the experts deem as necessary. But the experts in science and climate science in particular might know what is but they can't.

They cannot know what should be. They cannot know what policy should be implemented because that is not a matter of science alone but also economics among much else. It is a matter of how to generate wealth faster. And that may mean even if you are myopically focused on climate change that more use not less of fossil fuels is needed. Perhaps the solution is ultimately more fossil fuels so that you can build the sea walls and stronger structures and air conditioning can be made and so on and so forth more cheaply. Perhaps it is a device yet to be invented to sequester carbon dioxide by sucking it back out of the atmosphere. Perhaps it is fossil fuels as I have argued powering all of South America, Africa, Asia and elsewhere so that those places can have ubiquitous cheap energy so the children of today

become teenagers and adults of tomorrow who discover the solution to climate change. If that's what you're interested in. What I'm interested in is those people. Yes. Surely, but also people more broadly, including people in the West and the spreading of enlightenment values via a digital age and the knowledge economy everywhere so that everyone has the opportunity to be creative and solve the problems, whatever they are. climate change and otherwise this is urgent not because climate change is urgent but because knowledge production in general is urgent because we need knowledge to even notice problems we are yet to encounter we need to recognize as soon as possible problems before they overtake us before we have a chance to notice them the analogy is to a fast-moving asteroid perhaps a

a fragment of a distant supernova heading towards us at near light speed these are real possibilities but what about what they represent metaphorically as well to detect the problem in time so we can begin working on a solution and that takes knowledge knowledge takes energy energy needs to be paid for and that takes wealth the more expensive the energy the less wealth there is and the slower knowledge creation and the slower problem detection it could be lethally slow remember this chart of the costs of electricity we could have all the energy costs equal to or less than that of china if we too built more coal-fired power stations so let's stop hamstringing ourselves let's stop the guy i worship or if some must if some must have their pantheistic beliefs their animistic beliefs let them but let the rest of us

choose it's an easy solution let the market decide stop regulating energy production let companies build power stations and let users decide on that basis what they want to do if i want to purchase power from a coal-fired power plant or a solar panel it's all connected to the same grid so a simple calculation can be made when the demand for solar goes up easy build more and if people want more coal build more of those and people will pay for it accordingly based upon how much it costs to produce the power. Some prioritize progress and fast error correction and wealth creation and lifting people out of poverty. Some prioritize the planet and the environment. Let them have their beliefs as I say. Have their beliefs that renewables are better for the planet and as they argue that they're cheaper in the long run. They can test that theory for themselves. Let the rest of us test our theories as well. It's easy to do.

That's what the market is for. On the world stage China, India and Russia are enriching themselves while we impoverish ourselves when it comes to energy. We strengthen them while we weaken ourselves. It makes absolutely zero sense. Russia and China in particular are our strategic enemies and even our economic enemies as I've said before. It would be wonderful if this were not the case but trading with mass murderers like the regimes in China and Russia, they absolutely are mass murderers, is itself a great moral failing on our part. We in Australia do not need to try enriching ourselves so much by relying so heavily on trade with China if we simply allowed ourselves to use the very resources that we ship to them. We can sell to the USA, to India and Europe. Without compromising ourselves and our values. It makes zero sense as I've said to, for example,

ship coal to China for them to burn while we refuse to use more of it here. And as for shipping uranium around the world while we refuse to build nuclear reactors, that is facepalming behavior. These are not difficult questions. How to increase wealth and how to create the conditions under which knowledge grows faster. How to exploit our resources we are sitting atop of. Again, these are not difficult questions. We just need the courage to give the answers that are right under our noses. Thank you for watching and or listening to TopCast.
