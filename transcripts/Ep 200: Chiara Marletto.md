Welcome to TalkCast and to episode 200, plus or minus one, depending upon the platform you happen to consume TalkCast on. I began this podcast purely to help me clarify in my own mind the ideas of David Deutsch, which then became David Deutsch and Karl Popper, and then it became David Deutsch, Karl Popper and related thinkers. One of those related thinkers is my guest today. I have a guest, Chiara Marletto. It is rare indeed for me to have guests at all on TalkCast. It's just never been that kind of a podcast. It's more a monologue kind of a podcast. Not that I'm necessarily a monologue kind of a person, or am I? Of course, like almost every human being, I am primarily talking as part of a conversation with lots of other people. Nothing remarkable there. But these days, many of those conversations... These conversations are indeed actually recorded.

### 1m

And the place I prefer most for this is AirChat, which is a new app founded by Naval Ravikant and Brian Norgard. When I was a kid, I used to get involved in these strange conversations. I'm sure you had one as well. What would you prefer to lose if you were forced to choose your sight or your hearing? I think I used to always say, take my hearing. I can deal without that. I'll keep my sight. Thanks very much. But these days, I'm not quite so sure. I think I like to listen and talk. What Naval and Brian are building at AirChat is a place not merely to have conversations, but also it's a new way of creating podcasts. And that, of course, is center of the bullseye for my interest these days. I've got lots of fancy equipment here and try to make myself sound a lot better than I do in real life. But it is a job of work, as the British might say. I've got lots of fancy equipment here and try to make myself sound a lot better than I do in real life.

AirChat really streamlines things and is a marvelous supplement to this podcast, TalkCast for Me. It's a genuine way of turning this one-way channel of information into an actual two-way dialogue. It's talkback podcasting, and I absolutely love it. So come and talk to me at AirChat. Just search the App Store or whether you're an Apple person or an Android person. Just wherever you get your apps from. And you can find AirChat. It's better than Twitter Spaces or X Spaces, whatever they call it these days. It's better than voice messages left using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp or whatever else you might have tried. AirChat has all the bells and whistles involving studio-level production. Also AI and automatic translation, export facilities. It's got all of that stuff, but it's still simple to use. It sounds like an advertisement I'm doing. Well, it's not, believe me.

### 3m

It's just me singing the praises of something that not many people hitherto know about. It just happens to be something that I use near every single day. I mean, I'd sing the praises of my iPhone here, but, you know, everyone knows about iPhones and Apple products, and they need no special promotion by me. But for now, AirChat does remain a hidden gem on the Internet. TalkCast isn't going anywhere at all. But as part of a celebration for this episode 200 of my podcast, I want to let fans know that if you want to talk to me in person, I'm super responsive on AirChat. And, well, never mind me. You can actually talk to Naval yourself and a whole bunch of other people with really diverse interests. And if you've ever thought about getting into podcasting yourself, but you just think it's too difficult, well, AirChat could be a low-resistance way for you to do that. But let's go. Get to today's episode.

### 4m

One of those rare ones in which I'm actually talking to someone else. I completed the beginning of Infinity chapter exploration some years ago now, and I spoke to David Deutsch for episode 100. And at that time, I'd already commenced my explorations of his other book, The Fabric of Reality. And I began branching out, discussing some of Popper's work and comparing it to other thinkers, people like Sam Harris or Ayn Rand. Or Max Tegmark, lots of other people and their ideas. And Chiara Marletto published her first book around about this time that I began talking about The Fabric of Reality. And that book, The Science of Can and Can't, was the first popular, accessible-to-the-lay-person account of constructor theory. A new theory of science at the foundations of physics. I think popular science, for want of another term for books like this. Has an absolutely crucial role to play in culture, in transmitting our best ideas.

### 5m

I've said over and again that I could and indeed did do university physics even to a master's level. But none of it much helped me truly understand what was actually going on in quantum theory. Like the work of David Deutsch did. His book, The Fabric of Reality, chapter two, Shadows it's called, did more to help me understand quantum physics. Than multiple years sitting in lectures, tutorials and labs did at the university level. With fancy titles like Quantum Physics and Relativity 101 or Higher Quantum Physics 201. Any of that official type formalized stuff just didn't do it for me in the way that Shadows from this book happened to do. So when I first discovered that David Deutsch was working on a new theory of physics. And I read his... Technical papers on constructive theory.

### 6m

I began to read more widely into what this constructive theory stuff was. What von Neumann himself had said on the topic of a universal constructor. And then what prior thinkers had ever written about in terms of counterfactuals. I'd already done some philosophical work of my own on that at university. All that technical stuff can quite easily blow by you if you're not really engaged from the get-go. On what the problems even are that this new theory is trying to solve. Well this is where Chiara's book is just so helpful and was helpful to me in the same way that the Fabric of Reality was... In terms of quantum physics. The science of can and can't just lays it all out for you. It tells you about information theory and quantum information theory. Thermodynamics and epistemology in terms of the constructor theoretic view of what knowledge happens to be. And the significance of course of... Quantum physics. counterfactuals as part of physics, it's a wonderfully clear exposition of the theory as

### 7m

it stands right now. And I cannot recommend the book enough to anyone interested in the latest, deepest physics we know and how it connects to some areas of philosophy. So we explore the book today and lots more as well in this conversation. I even managed to press Chiara on that great issue of our time, the supposed looming superintelligence explosion, or the AI apocalypse. It was such a privilege to speak to Chiara. And although TOCCast is not about to pivot into being an interview show by any means, I will be speaking, I hope, to some more physicists over the coming months on TOCCast and AirChat as well, as we continue to explore the fabric of reality, both the book and literally the fabric of reality through the content I create. And publish through various channels here. Without further ado, though, enjoy this conversation with

### 8m

Chiara Marletta. Hello, Chiara, and thanks so much for joining me for the 200th episode of TOCCast. My second only guest ever, actually. So it seems like on average, I get one guest every hundred episodes or so. So welcome. Thank you. Let's dive straight in. There's so many facets to your work, and I want to get to the substance of exactly what it is that you work on. But I thought first, it'd be interesting to know about what's brought you here, because you're in a particularly deep area of physics. And I've known a lot of people who have gone into physics. And your area is the deepest. And many people go into physics because they're drawn to astrophysics. They love the pretty images of space or geophysics. There's money to be made by digging stuff out of the ground. And of course, these days, there's very fashionable areas of physics like quantum computation. And, you know, if that part of your career is to be a physicist, then you've got to pay off. That's going to be big. That's going to revolutionize things. But somehow, you've managed

### 9m

to find yourself even deeper still than quantum computation. You found yourself at the very foundations of physics. And in fact, you're still digging. It's amazing. So can you take me back to Chiara, perhaps at school, perhaps any influences from your family that might have been instrumental there? Read between the lines in the science of can and can't. And it seems like your father had a deep influence on you. And I think that's a really good question. I think that's a really good question. I think that's a really good question. I think that's a really good question. And your journey from there as a child growing up in Italy through to undergraduate and finally to where you are now, perhaps the leading researcher with just a few others, a handful of others on what purports to be a candidate for our deepest new theory of physical reality. Yeah. Actually, thinking with hindsight is always interesting because you create a narrative, right, for what you did. And I'm sure that there were a number of events, during this story that caused me to do various things. But I think the way I think about it now

### 10m

is more or less like this, that initially, I think I really enjoyed the idea of understanding the world in various ways. And I think this was clear to me already when early on, I think when my father's particularly, but both my parents, I think they like to tell me lots of stories. And these stories really, fascinated me as a child. So I loved storytelling. I love the idea of creating some kind of, well, what I would call now an explanation about things. You know, a good story is actually a good explanation where you put together the characters in a nice way, and then out comes a great plot. And then this love for storytelling kind of gradually turned into love for explanation. So for having some kind of deeper understanding of things. And then in secondary school, I think I

### 11m

really liked philosophy. So I was taken by these early philosophers, you know, the Greeks and so on. And it sounded very interesting that they were trying to understand these concepts like infinity and space and time and the universe, etc. And then only later, I actually realized that I was looking in the wrong place in the sense that, well, philosophy is very interesting, but the thing that really goes at the heart of things is physics. And so that's how towards the end of secondary school, I matured this interest for science and physics specifically. And I thought that I would want to dig deeper and see whether, you know, it was really the thing that I was hoping it would be that you really could tell me something more about, you know, the way that reality works. And then, you know, this this turned into a love for physics, this interest. And I think the

### 12m

the most interesting thing that I still find interesting now is this fact that you can come up with explanations for, you know, for what happens around you. And these explanations are unifying and they're universal, if they're good, and they sort of really take you much, much deeper than what you can sense or perceive directly with your senses. And they tell a very interesting, compelling story about the universe. And I think the more compelling the story is, the better the explanation is, et cetera. And anyway, I think it was towards the end of my master's in Torino that I I realized this fact that somehow this part of physics that was very interesting to me for quantum physics was also extremely mysterious, the way it was presented by teachers, right, and lecturers. And I think that this was very confusing, in fact, and at least to me. And so this

### 13m

brought me into thinking that maybe I would want to understand the foundations of this field. And so somehow asking here and there, it turned out that quantum information was the field where, you know, one could find perhaps a better understanding of quantum physics itself. And that's how I ended up doing a PhD in Oxford. So that's this. And that's where I started working with Arthur Eckert and various other people that I started working with here. And that's how I ended up being a researcher actually in this field. And I think it's always been this interest for trying to find deeper explanations. I think that's the thing that really attracted me to physics and made physics so somehow it I singled it out, out of various other disciplines that were also fascinating to me as the people who understand reality. And that, that is really mind blowing. It's something that

### 14m

perhaps you don't realise at first in school. As you, you've already pointed out many times, I guess, yourself, often, you know, teachers, maybe because they're constrained by various things, syllabus, and there's other things they may not have the time to, to explain the physics is about this fascinating activity. But I think this should be said, much more often to students, because it would cast a completely different light on physics itself, that usually is perceived maybe as a bit of a sterile, sort of a bit of a hard subject that doesn't, it's a bit sort of dry subject that doesn't really give you a lot of, you know, satisfaction, maybe, as you approach it at first. But actually, this, this couldn't be further away from, from truth really, it's really, it's really a very deep enterprise and, and yeah, I guess that's why I'm sort of in this. And so far, it's proven really exciting.

### 15m

So I'm happy about the choices. I've seen you up on stage defending the Everettian quantum theory interpretation, the many worlds, the multiverse. I'm just wondering now, it strikes me, were you already on board? Had you already been persuaded that this was the explanation of quantum theory? Or did you have to wait until you met Arthur and David and you're in the Oxford community before you understood that? Or did you already go to Oxford and understanding the Everettian interpretation? So I was lucky that I, so initially, I think the way I was presenting quantum physics in, in, you know, in undergrad, in my undergraduate degree was, was simply the usual way that, that is very baffling and confusing, which uses this idea of, of collapse, really, of the wave function, right? And I guess this takes you as far as, you know, passing exams and doing calculations. But I think somehow, if you start questioning,

### 16m

you know, what is the meaning of all this, you start realizing that maybe this is not the right way of looking at things. So I was lucky that one of my lecturers, which was then the person that I did my thesis with, this theoretician called Mario Rossetti, he, he had an interest in quantum information. And because of that, he had already been primed into thinking that, you know, that actually it's better to look at quantum theory in this reversible unitary way, which is at the heart of the Everettian interpretation. So even though maybe Mario wasn't, I would say, you know, he may have been gently skeptical about Everettian, the Everettian interpretation itself. He was very much in, in, in, in favor of this understanding, of the measurement as a, as a, as a phenomenon that you can describe within quantum physics.

### 17m

So, you know, you can describe the observer within quantum physics and so on. And, and once you start looking at quantum theory this way, you see, first of all, the measurements make much more sense because they are described just any other, like any other interaction that, you know, you describe within, within the theory. And observers as well, right? So they're just physical subsystems and they can be as small or as large as you like. It doesn't matter. They all, all fit in, into the description. And I think that was something that I already had in my head when I sort of arrived in Oxford. And then in Oxford, I think the, you know, the, the way in which quantum information works and how you think about things is deeply rooted into this idea of, of many worlds or, and so in that sense, it was then a kind of perfecting this understanding. And definitely I understood much more during the PhD. Uh, when I thought more careful about some of these aspects with David and Arthur and

### 18m

Vlad Kovedril and so on, and other people here that, that sort of developed the aspects of these, of this theory in different directions. But yeah, but I think I had this, um, initial dissatisfaction with the club's, uh, way of thinking about things and, uh, somehow I was, uh, you know, once you enter quantum information theory, uh, the way I did with my lecturer at the time, um, my thesis advisor, that sort of, uh, I, I, I somewhat fell in love with, uh, with, um, with the way of thinking, uh, about measurement and observers in a unit, in a kind of unified way. And I thought that because it's consistent and it doesn't create problems, um, I thought, you know, why do you complicate your, why, why complicate your life with collapses and other things that create other issues? Let's just go with what the theory says and see what the consequences are. And even if they are, uh, perplexing from the philosophical point of view, in fact, that's all the better, right?

### 19m

You know, there's, there's more to think about and, and it means the theory is doing what it's supposed to do, which is to surprise you and give you a deeper understanding of things. Um, yeah. So that's how I ended up here, I guess. No special physics, no magic for the observer, no special way of needing to account for these things. Just have this unitary, universal theory that applies to everything, everywhere, all the time. Yes. Um, yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. So, so when, when we dig ever deeper, we find that things you tend to unify. And you know, of course this is, uh, shown by the unification between quantum theory and computation. You end up with quantum computation and you're going deeper than that. There is this sense in which while the, the quantum computer in principle, when we have a universal one, one day we'll be able to compute anything that can be computed. It cannot itself transform matter. But this is where, and eventually we'll get there to talk about, this in perhaps more detail um the universal constructor however would have this property

### 20m

we don't know how to make one or anything like that yet it's worth stressing though that constructor theory that very term can sometimes make people think it's only about this universal constructor it's only about looking for this universal constructor but actually it's a theory about counterfactuals which you lay out so brilliantly in your book things that might have been but are not or things that could be and might be brought about if only we make some effort things like that so it could be the counterfactual other universe that physically exists out there in some higher order space or it could even be a universe with different physical laws constructor theory could in principle be able to deal with these different kinds of problems perhaps you could sketch the link for me between the universal constructor or constructors in general and counterfactuals perhaps begin by telling the audience who's my audience typically very general of what even a counterfactual is yeah so um that is a term that i'm using that we use uh

### 21m

together with with david uh to to indicate a particular set of properties that are relevant in physics and they have to do with um what is uh permitted possible or impossible um and so uh it's it's um it says you know into in kind of contrast with uh what usually dynamical laws are about once you specify an initial condition because once you do that you are telling a story about what happens will happen or has happened depending on where you're looking at um in the universe or in space and time if you like to have a kind of relativistic viewpoint um and it doesn't because you single out a specific point you can't do that you can't do a specific trajectory you are um avoiding mentioning other possibilities um and also because you see

### 22m

you're singling out a specific dynamical law you're avoiding mentioning that there could be other laws that might um well apply to to describing and explaining what what uh the phenomena at hand are um but you're not considering that in in standard uh you know dynamics because you you just you have a particular dynamical law and then you see what the predictions are given so some boundary or initial conditions whereas counterfactuals um counterfactual principles for example uh are are laws that refer to this um set of allowed or disallowed transformations and in doing so they also implicitly single um well they rule in or out a certain set of dynamics and a certain set of initial conditions uh but they um they have a sort of they exist at a higher level uh compared to to these dynamical laws because they can constrain them and so you can think of these principles about counterfactuals as guidelines for um for guessing dynamics uh and and uh

### 23m

boundary conditions uh and so theories of initial conditions etc and and so you you can see how they capture an additional aspect uh that is relevant to physics and so in my book and generally speaking in my work i've been uh showing trying to find problems where where this viewpoint is more fruitful and allows you uh you know a set of methodology allows you to have a set of methodology at hand that that uh otherwise you wouldn't you wouldn't you wouldn't be able to to to use and so it's more effective at solving problems in those specific cases now the connection between a counterfactual and constructors and universal constructors is um more or less like this that so if you think of the uh of the universal constructor uh the way that phenomenon

### 24m

defined it implicitly uh is as a machine that uh can be programmed to perform any physical transformations that's allowed by the laws of physics uh i guess this is maybe a slightly more constructive version of whatever von neumann said in his writings but i think that that's the gist of what he had in mind i think um and so this machine um has a repertoire right so he has a it has a sort of set of transformation that it can perform when given the right program and there are a set of transformations that you cannot perform no matter what kind of program you you provide in input and if you think about what this repertoire looks like is a way of uh it's really a set of counterfactuals um it's a set of rules that um that somehow tell you what transformations are allowed and disallowed in in in the physical world so there's a sense in which if a universal constructor is is possible

### 25m

in a given universe studying the set of transformations that it can or cannot perform is equivalent to studying the whole of physics in the sense that the laws of physics put constraints on this repertoire of the universal constructor and um understanding why a universal constructor cannot perform some transformations like for example uh creating energy out of no energy or or something of this sort um is in fact understanding why there has to be a certain principle of physics that says that these transformations are disallowed or allowed and so um this is the connection so the idea is that as you are building this theory of the universal constructor which you can think constructor theory is an instance of at the same time you go uncovering a number of principles that uh tell you how physical reality works and some of these principles

### 26m

uh we may already have some such you know some we have some of them already in a sense and maybe not formulated in a fully constructed theoretic way but for example uh thermodynamics is an area where principles of this kind like the second law of thermodynamics or conservation of energy that i mentioned uh already tell you a little bit of uh what are the constraints that the universal constructor has to deal with when you know thinking of which transformations it can perform and it cannot perform um but then there are extra principles principles that have to do for example with information theory um and other aspects of physics that we haven't really tackled properly yet and the hope is that this approach with counterfactuals the constructor theory has allows us to formulate these principles um and then you know thereby adding supplementary laws to the laws and then allowing us to to to guess uh better explanations for for for physics

### 27m

so the and this idea that studying the repertoire of a programmable machine like the universal constructor allows you to understand physics and discover laws of physics is an idea that is deeply seated within the quantum theory of information and i think this is some a theme that is very uh dear to to david uh dosh because i think the way in which uh in you know the the the way in which quantum information theory was initially uh discovered um also uh you know by other pioneers um was really that they were these people were trying to understand how quantum physics works and they realized that quantum computers and specific to the universal quantum computer being um you know using quantum theories uh most fundamental properties um where you know these quantum computers were actually a good object to study to understand

### 28m

quantum theory itself and now we are just expanding this logic to a wider set of machines that are more general than computers and these are constructors and hopefully to the universal constructor which is the most general programmable machine that one can think of and note that maybe the universal constructor is not possible so we don't know if that's possible or not uh under the you know laws of physics that we have but that itself is something of a+, important thing or many, important no time creating is a way to understand how the laws of physics work and how reality works. So in that sense, it's part of this program to find out whether a universal constructor is allowed or not. So even a failure would be a success in a sense, even if you were to find that you can't construct this thing called the universal construct, that tells you something very deep about the laws of physics and the universe. Well, let's get to information then. What is information? I mean, we hear about it talked in terms of computer science. We also have the version of information that falls under the thermodynamic kind of rules as well.

### 29m

So what is information in the classic sense and how is it different to quantum information? So I think this is a very nice example of a property that you can only talk about in terms of counterfactuals if you want to provide a sort of satisfactory, fairly satisfactory, physics definition for what is information. And I think the way you do that is to shift a little bit the focus. Instead of saying what information is, as thinking of it as a sort of substance or something like that, you say what transformations must be allowed on a physical system for it to contain what we all agree can be called information. And if you look at that, it's quite elegant and simple. You can notice that, you know, there are a couple of properties

### 30m

that you want a physical system of that kind to have. So the first property is the fact that it has to have a set of states that you can interchange. So if you think of a bit, there are two states and you want to be able to flip zero into one and one into zero. So these are two counterfactual properties. The fact that you can perform these tasks of flipping, zero and one into one another. And then the other property that you want is that these values of the state in question can be copied. If you have a replica of this system, just like you can do with a bit, you expect a good bit to be interchangeable with another bit. And also, if you have two bits together, you want to be able to copy the value of one onto the other, ideally to arbitrarily high accuracy. And of course, with bits, we take this for granted. But if you think of what this means in terms of physics, this requires a number of symmetries to be present in the dynamical laws that rule your physical systems.

### 31m

And not all physical systems have these properties and not all dynamical laws allow for these properties. And so classical information really requires this idea of permutability of states, the fact that you can flip states into one another and copyability. And then the way in which this classical information is different from quantum information is that quantum systems have extra properties. So not only can they embody information in this way, so they have sets of states that can be flipped into each other and copied in this way. But they have extra properties that some transformations are also impossible in this set of states, and and the and the classic property in the case of quantum systems is the fact that if you take

### 32m

two different ways of embodying a bit that a single quantum system has with different physical properties, for example the orientation of a spin along a given axis and then the orientation of the spin along a different axis, if you want to then use all of these states together as an information carrier, you will find out that you cannot and the reason is that you cannot copy all of them simultaneously with the same device. So this copyability property fails at a certain level in the sense that not all states of a quantum systems are copyable in the same way that zero and one are copyable in a classical bit. And paradoxically this fact that you have somehow more constraints, you have fewer possibilities available, so you have an extra constraint that says that some things are impossible, suddenly gives you extra computing power if you consider more quantum bits together and that's one of the aspects that allows you to

### 33m

have for example things like entanglement and so on. But the key difference is really in this copyability property that you have an extra constraint on copyability for quantum systems which you don't have for classical bits. It's fascinating isn't it, it's almost like a life lesson, there's more constraints but it actually increases the power in some way of this system. Yes it's quite nice thought that sometimes constraints are good and they can open up possibilities. Yes and we should say to people that anyone who wants to learn more about information and quantum information, I've never seen a more clarifying way of explaining this than chapters three and four of the science of quantum physics. That's right. So you know holidays are coming up, Christmas is coming up, so if anyone's got someone in their family or in their life who's interested in anything from the basics of science through to cutting edge physics and information theory then this is the book for you and it gives you

### 34m

a rundown of everything from quantum theory through to thermodynamics and even epistemology and we're going to get there as well. But we've just talked about information and there is this article that's out there, published 2014, New Scientist that you co-wrote with David Deutsch, and I can guarantee that you guys did not write the title to the article because the article is titled Reconstructing Physics, the Universe's Information, which is John Wheeler's position, the it from bit thing, and David Deutsch of course wrote famously it from qubit where he counted all of that. So is it true, Chiara, as one of the world experts on quantum information theory, is the universe at bottom information? No, and I think that, yeah, the title was, you know, happened as a sort of glitch in the process of publication, but yeah, I think that's good because we can then talk about the reason why that's not true. And the reason is that the, so first, information is this entity that

### 35m

you cannot use, so it's something that is, you can't use it as primitive, it's a thing that rests, as I said, on a number of things. So it's a system of entities, you know, that has a number of properties that systems may not have. And in fact, there are systems in the universe that don't necessarily work as information media, so they don't have these two counterfactual properties, counterfactual properties that I mentioned earlier. So that already in itself says that the universe can't be information, just informational, because there are other things that may not have those properties. And there are still physical systems and we still, you know, study them. going to say what i was saying earlier that you know you have these quantum states um of a quantum system that uh you know they're perfectly allowed states but if you try to put them together to

### 36m

you know to to embody a bit you can't do that because they're not copyable so that's an example of a system that you can't use to to embody information in the way that um that the one expects a bit should do um and then the other reason is that the way we think about information is really as a as a thing that is explained in terms of other things so it's it's you know when you say that certain tasks are allowed permitted to permit information to be embodied in a physical system you are referring to some more elementary properties that these systems must have in order to information to to be uh instantiated in them and so these properties are the most fundamental things and maybe even they could be decomposed into more primitive things so somehow it's the title is also problematic because it somehow suggests that there is this idea of a finite um you know sort of ultimate uh primitive entity in an explanation that

### 37m

you can come up in physics um and i i think that's not the case um and you know usually in physics when you find something that you think oh no no you know now we understood everything and everything is is done and dusted there's always something that uh is a bit problematic and then if you start digging a bit more in that direction you find that there's a hole and then this hole leads to a future theory and so it's it's a bit uh yeah i think the the title is also in a way too pessimistic that says that everything can be explained in terms of one thing uh these things usually can be explained themselves in terms of what's going on in physics and that's part of the game of physics that's why it's exciting so yeah i would say that's constructive theory definitely is not about explaining that that's the case in fact it's trying to counter this position and providing more fundamental uh explanatory elements in terms of which you can explain information and other things

### 38m

and they are based on these counterfactuals um as i was saying earlier but there are many true believers in this simulation hypothesis um do you have any remarks on that this idea that we are in fact inside a simulation you haven't seen any any any fingerprints of the great programmer out there in your your work yeah i that's that's an interesting hypothesis in the sense that um it's not so sometimes in physics we have to rule out things as not necessarily just because we can't uh you know we observe something that that refuse them but also because they are not good explanations it's simply um it's like when you discuss the existence of god you know it's it's um you can't disprove the existence of god by observing things but you can say that you know if you're a physicist and you're thinking about the world and trying to understand it saying that certain things originated with it uh is not a good explanation so we we have to to find something else and likewise in this case um this theory is is not

### 39m

explanatory because the programmer is is not explained so so we we have to uh i mean at least that's the way i think of physics that physics exactly tries to take these things that are unexplained and build you know sort of decompose them into things that can be explained uh and that's actually what you know going back to the initial question that's what got me into physics in the first place and that's why i find it fascinating and i think david has remarked once before that if we're in a simulation running on what computer where under what theory of computation so yeah then you have to explain all of that and then that would itself somehow be a different theory from the theory that we are in a simulation now the science of canon can't your book it contains not only this material as i said about information theory and quantum information theory but there's a substantive section there on thermodynamics and we've already talked a little we touched a little

### 40m

on thermodynamics thermodynamics doesn't seem to see if you study a physics degree or if you do physics in high school you might very well encounter some relativity you might encounter some quantum theory certainly by the time you get to undergraduate you're going to realize that these are the two theories that do capture that our best explanations as well but the laws of thermodynamics don't sit neatly in either of those and there are a set of principles why are they different and what is in particular different about the second law it's always held up as having some almost religious significance in many areas of science yeah the the second law is um very interesting beast because uh first of all there are many versions of it and so when people say third second law they often mean different things even specialists they have you know there's a way to think about it uh in the statistical mechanics sense so walsman's you know way of of imagining

### 41m

this law as emerging out of some procedure that allows you to say well we have a certain set of dynamical trajectories and uh if we take um some common sense assumptions about them we end up noticing that the most likely point of equilibrium of a given system when let it you know to itself has um a certain property that we can summarize in terms of its uh entropy um being sort of maximized and and then you have a different way of talking about the second law which is the the way in which uh kelvin clausius and the founding fathers of the phenomenological thermodynamics were thinking about it which is in terms of this idea that you cannot convert heating to work with other without any other side effects and so you know that explains why you cannot use heat to power a boat and and so on um and and many others actually there's some nuanced you know different versions

### 42m

of these various principles that i mentioned now but you know that's that's a little bit of a uh the problem with all of them is that somehow they just like with the whole thermodynamics to to go back to your question thermodynamics is often thought of as being a collection of recipes that allow you to uh make some predictions uh they're very useful to you know uh to figure out how a heat engine you know works and and what's the efficiency and so on um but they are not that fundamental so somehow they're all sort of as applying at this higher you know larger scale microscopic systems and if you go however down to the microscopic um dynamics that's the fundamental thing so dynamics really tells you the whole story and then because you can't maybe compute sometimes the dynamics is intractable you cannot solve the equations it's useful to have some

### 43m

thermodynamics helping you out there but it doesn't really tell you much about nothing fundamental that's i think a very widespread view in in physics and certainly what you get maybe the first time you encounter thermodynamics in in courses uh however there's something to be said about that in the sense that you can uh question that statement and in fact imagine that perhaps the reason why the laws of thermodynamics appear to be um just applicable to this macroscopic scale is that we haven't really expressed them properly so uh there could be a way of formulating them in such a way that they are still compatible with the fundamental dynamics that we have for microscopic particles but at the same time these laws add to to those dynamical laws simply because the thermodynamics is formulated at this higher level of abstraction where you're not picking a particular formalism so you're not

### 44m

expressing them in the newtonian or hamiltonian formalism or in in the you know applying schrodinger equation to a particular case they they are formulated at the level of abstraction of principles and so they have this power of allowing us to um single out specific laws and say that they are allowed and others are not and so if we had an exact more um precise version of the second law this would do us a great service because we could then use it in order to um you know guess maybe future theories of physics uh etc and in a sense i think thermodynamics has been used in this way in the past secretly in a way but but but physicists have been using it in this way too except that um as i said it's still difficult to do that because the principles are at some scale just break down so you don't know

### 45m

what they tell you about the specific system so that's that's one aspect that makes thermodynamics at the same time interesting but also frustrating because it has this feature of being incomplete in my view and then there is this other aspect which is uh well one of the most interesting ones which is the fact that the second law particularly is a law that says that there must be some kind of irreversibility occurring at a certain scale or in you know in some sense and what the convert work into heat you cannot go back without side effects or you know the fact that once you increase entropy and then the system is isolated it just stays there and so there are different ways in which people think about irreversibility but there is this idea and unfortunately irreversibility appears to be just in conflict with the fact that the dynamical laws that rule

### 46m

the microscopic dynamics are time reverse symmetric so they don't display irreversibility so there is this conflict and that's also why people tend to think that thermodynamics can only hold in an approximate way because they say well if the dynamical laws are true then it must be there to get some irreversibility out of something that's reversible we've got to do some approximations um and that's true in bothman's case it's true in partly in the thermodynamic phenomenological thermodynamics case of of clauses and kelvin etc um and then again here i would say maybe that's not true maybe the the the reason why we are finding this hard to reconcile these two things irreversibility and reversibility is that we are not expressing the irreversibility at the right level so we're not using the right tools and this is where constructive theory comes in because i think that there's a way of talking about irreversibility

### 47m

in terms of the fact that a task is possible in one direction but not in the reverse which is still compatible with the fact that dynamical laws are reversible simply because a task being performed doesn't correspond to the fact that the dynamical trajectory is allowed so there are two different concepts and so the fact that you say the task is possible in the forward direction but not in the reverse direction doesn't necessarily contradict the fact that the trajectories of particles that compose the substrates of these tasks are in fact reversible in the way that we expect them to be and so that's what i've kind of been discussing in the book and i've been working on in my work with also with some collaborators here and that's very exciting because it kind of gives you a way out of this apparent dichotomy between reversibility and irreversibility that you're stuck with if you stay within the traditional conception of physics so this way out would that involve showing that a constructor cannot be built

### 48m

which would now enable you to reverse certain processes yes yes and i think uh this idea was already there in the early days relatively early days of thermodynamics for example uh planck has uh a lot of writings about this uh and the you know the the key experiment where you know a jewel experiment where you have um a sort of uh isolation in uh a sort of uh adiabatically isolated um adiabatically isolated enclosure with with some water inside and you have a uh stirrer that can sort of be actioned by mechanical means to increase its temperature that's one task so increase the temperature of this of this uh jar of water uh by mechanical means only it's an example of um a statement of the kind there is a

### 49m

constructor that can perform the task in this direction so of increasing the temperature of the temperature but then if you try to look at whether there could be a constructor that can perform the reverse task meaning cool down the bucket or the jar of water by the same means so just by using mechanical means by stirring you will see that there's no such constructor and it's not because you haven't thought hard enough it's simply because that's one instance of the second law and Planck already had this I would say construct theoretic intuition in fact I was very much inspired by his works in the sense that he is already talking about the fact that in one direction you can have a cycle that can perform a transformation and in the opposite direction there isn't such a cycle and the cycle is really a constructor so it's an object that can perform a transformation then be reset to its original state without undoing the transformation itself

### 50m

and now if you this is okay in standard thermodynamics we we know this but if you now try to elevate this as a as you know um at the to the rank of the principle uh and and try to imagine exactly a statement of the second law that says the constructor is allowed in one direction but not in the other of a given transformation and you see uh you you you know you you want to see whether this statement is compatible with the fact that the dynamics the rules the elementary components of these entities is a reversible dynamics you will see that actually the two statements are compatible and it's simply because the fact that the fact that you have a task that's performable by a constructor in one direction but not in the reverse isn't in contradiction with the fact that the dynamics that you're running is reversible because if you run the dynamics in reverse you're not performing the task in reverse I think that's a very subtle idea and and my collaborator I think Maria Violares was the person who actually demonstrated this within a sort of quantum model

### 51m

even with an actual system showing that this is the case that you know reversible laws of quantum theory are compatible with this statement and and that's that's fun that's interesting um and it's a hope to have actually a formulation of the second law which is exact um so it's to do really with how hard the task is in one direction as opposed to the opposite direction and and you can be even quantitative about this um just in a slightly different way from from the usual way that you're doing thermodynamics with entropies so if you were to stir your sugar in your tea on average the kinetic energy of the particles inside of your tea is going to increase simply because the one measure of temperature is that if the average temperature the average kinetic energy of the particles is a measure of the temperature now there's no such stirring that could go on which would slow down the particles in fact if you wanted to slow down the particles you'd have to have information about them and then to break them in some way and that seems to be uh at the

### 52m

very least an intractable task to do yes so you could do it with other means right so you could cool down the bucket of what you know the jar of water or the tea but you would have to use a heat sink which is uh not just a mechanical source of work so you would have to sort of allow for uh some kind of dissipation if you like or you would have to sort of um involve in the constructor an additional element that wasn't there in one direction so that's that's that's the idea so the same kind of constructor that works in one direction doesn't work in the reverse direction and this is true for many tasks so in fact this thermodynamic this view of thinking of the second law allows you to generalize it to other realms of of physics where you may not have something like a thermal equilibrium or temperature and things like that but you still have this irreversibility present because a certain task is harder when you have the thermal one way than the opposite way uh where harden means what i just said that you know a given

### 53m

constructor in one direction doesn't work for the backward direction now um you're working on some of what i would say the most interesting and deep problems in the entirety of science but and i know you don't have a huge social media presence so you may miss the fact that the topic du jour at the moment is the oncoming apocalypse from the ai and agi people who think that super intelligence is about to take over the world and they might very well be screaming at you kiara my letter that you should be using your brain power to try and solve this to try and stop the the robots from taking over the world have you got a view on this at all it is the topic du jour at the moment with gpt4 people are very very excited that these things are about to become self-aware and self-improving and escape from the box what do you think about how close we are if that's the right word to agi and whether or not uh ai is going to escape from our control well um okay on on how close we are um yeah i'm not an

### 54m

expert i think the it seems to me we are very far and the problem is that actually we don't even know where we are that's the problem because it seems to me that we don't have uh an understanding of what what is what the target is so the problem with uh this study in artificial intelligence is that uh for sure there are some technological developments that are stunning and interesting that no one denies that but somehow they're not doing what we would be hoping they you know they they they should be doing in the sense that um the we don't have a i think a theory a good understanding a good scientific theory of what um the capacity uh you know what what what what um the capacity of the brain is in the sense that we don't have

### 55m

a way to define properties that like creativity or originality or consciousness we can call them in many many different ways intelligence i uh you know i don't mind which terminology you use but we all know what roughly what we mean but we don't have a theory of what that is like a scientific theory it tells us that's what we want uh so therefore when you know when when we have a particular way of um dealing with certain optimization problems within a programmable machine then we say oh great we are sort of doing what you were emulating human thinking that's to me is very hard to believe because we don't know what human thinking really does of course we know at the microscopic level what happens in the brain there are atoms and they obey quantum theory then at a high level there are neurons and we have an understanding at the medical level of various processes and various other things but then there's the gap between that understanding which is

### 56m

good and the higher level description of what's going on in the mind when we come up with an idea um and so in that sense i think we can't say that we're making that much progress if we haven't you know first we should develop this theory and then we can then say okay look we managed now to do this and that and that uh so that's my my view on that topic the other aspect is should we should we worry about it well uh yeah i mean i think you should be uh i mean that's a question that you can ask about lots of pieces of technology and well more than worrying is more like we should think about having a good uh you know a good basis in the society for how to use these things and these are things that i guess scientists can't help much with uh not not at least in their profession so scientists do think about the stuff

### 57m

and they produce things and then these things get used and they can be used in a good way or in a bad way uh and it seems to me this is the problem that happens with any technological development that is disruptive just think about when cars came about right so i'm sure that people were worried about people being run over in the streets and and so on and then there was an issue of how do we regulate these things etc and then some rules were put on and then some of them knew it was ridiculous but others were not and then the the rules that were lacking were removed and gradually we co-evolved etc so i think these are problems that exist not specifically in relation to this technology i don't see this as a particularly uh you know as a singularity i think it's just another kind of technology that we are developing and we have to of course think about how to use it wisely um and finally i want to say this thing that there is this aspect that we can't even know we don't even know how to how to instill in a human

### 58m

you know how do we create this is something that probably teachers are uh you know very much interested in and parents how do we make how do we help a human a human being that's growing up for example to uh become passionate about knowledge and and become passionate about having new ideas and or never mind whether they're growing up even even uh you know adults how do we how do we make someone interested in things and and and creative and um i don't know there are theories about education some of them are good others not um but we we don't have an understanding of how this process uh works and so uh this is a very big problem it's it's it's a big problem because you know we have lots of more time you know we have lots more time on our hands because of technology which is good uh at least in part of the world but then i'm not sure we're using the time properly so it would be nice if instead of

### 59m

wasting the time we could use it to to do something creative uh it's a very important point i mean um the the the discussion right now is all around agi and trying to find avenues to agi concerns about agi but actually we've got these things gis these you know people these um and we don't even know yet how to maximize as you say their creativity within ourselves so never mind the the artificial version the the natural version has has enough problems i suppose so that's one hobby another hobby horse that arises um out of your book which i'm absolutely fascinated by which is the question of fine tuning the fine tuning of the constants and the laws of nature you seem to have been inspired a little at least by the goldilocks enigma which touches on this topic and it was one that was specially focused on this issue often davies writes these grand books that cover a whole lot of things but this book is a great one because

### 1h 0m

it focuses in on uh the question of fine tuning for for listeners that that the problem seems to be that the constants of nature or the parameters seem to be fine-tuned and then indeed the laws themselves seem to be fine-tuned for life change this or that parameter and forget about life in the universe it might be a matterless void or it might just be one big huge ball of hydrogen something like that if we start changing the laws of nature we seem to radically transform what's possible out there what what does constructor theory add to this discussion if anything about the mystery that it seems to be fine-tuning because some people have denied it's ever been a problem i remember uh the late victor stenger he was the first person to write a book about fine-tuning and he one of his final books that he published before his death was the fallacy of fine-tuning and he was a particle physicist who denied there was even a problem nothing to see

### 1h 1m

here kind of thing but many people since have written books to say no no no this is a real genuine problem does constructor theory add a new window on the question of fine-tuning yeah this is um an interesting uh direction something that uh you know is one of those maybe unexpected things that maybe constructors here could be up with could be of help with um the so the first thing to notice is that the again the formulation of the fine-tuning problem is itself a bit uh problematic in the sense that when you when you think of varying a law of physics there are many different ways in which you can do that and um it's difficult to define a definition of a law of physics even uh from a distance in the space of all theories from the theory that you have because you know it depends what what you are varying but uh you may be varying some constants in

### 1h 2m

the laws or you may be varying the form you know you can add terms and see what happens if the terms are you know growing in magnitude and so on um but it's really a very difficult job to guess in which direction to make evidence or to put in or any kind of analysis in terms of the the exact change in the form of the laws or the the things that are true and in which way they change variation and so it's difficult to be quantitative about what is a small and what is a big variation in a given given a particular law so that's already a problem and the thing that constructed here brings in here is that it first of all it gives you a way to see that if you formulate the laws in a different way you will see that what counts as a small variation in this other way of formulating the laws may actually be a very big variation in the in in the standard way of using dynamical laws so in the case of constructor theory imagine you have a instead of your dynamical law that I don't know Newton's

### 1h 3m

laws or whatever quantum theories laws that are probably more closer to the truth than the Newton's in that case you just have these dynamics and you can vary it in the ways that I said or other ways and notice that if you do that you end up with laws that don't even allow for things like chemical bonds to occur and and so therefore the very basic building blocks of reality are just falling apart and so let alone life but in constructive theory you have a different way of formulating the laws right so you have this set of principles that basically have you know if you imagine the set of all possible transformations they divide it into two camps one being the possible transformations and the other being the impossible transformations now what is a small variation there I don't know but it could be that a small variation is a

### 1h 4m

small modification of this boundary of what is possible right so you could slightly enlarge it to make it smaller and so you have fewer tasks available and and which tasks do you choose in order to make this variation so all of these questions are not answered but they they are there to illustrate that supposing that you take this view about how to make a small variation in the constructive theory way of formulating laws and then you want to see what that looks like in the traditional conception of physics you will see that the the change so what you're changing is a set of tasks being possible but you're still changing the set of tasks being possible but you're still requiring some tasks to be possible and that doesn't correspond to to the small change in the other camp in the in the in the traditional conception of physics

### 1h 5m

way of formulating things so this is to illustrate that we don't know how to formulate the problem in the first place so it's one one first thing to say the other thing to say is that if you look at the laws in constructive theory and you consider the fact that if you want some tasks this is a long argument to be made but in short if you want a task that requires objects of a given of a certain complexity to be created out of elementary material materials you will always require a number of things to be allowed by the laws of physics for these tasks to be possible for this complex object to be producible out of elementary building blocks and

### 1h 6m

these things include stable bonds not only that they also include life entities that can error correct to be around so that the task can be performed to better and better accuracy etc so a small variation in the constructive theory sense so changing just a set of tasks slightly that are possible doesn't necessarily mean that you end up with a huge variation in in the possibility of things like life but not only life chemistry and other things so it doesn't seem to so this seems to indicate that if you take a naive way of changing the laws by a small variation in constructive theory you don't incur in this bizarre huge variations that lead to a problem as in the traditional conception of physics now this is a speculation so it's something that we haven't really worked on but I think it's an interesting lesson somehow that constructive theory teaches us at this level that something that looks like a

### 1h 7m

huge problem in a given formulation may not exist in a in a different one and watch this space in the sense that I don't know how this will end but it's an interesting consideration yeah well constructive theory opens up a new way of looking at traditional problems in new ways which is always a promising Avenue for our ability to make progress one of the most exciting parts of the book and which I say again it's not just that the science of can and can't is a pure science book it also is a book that I would say comfortably fits alongside the beginning and infinity the fabric of reality it's like a cousin to those books and it's in the lineage of you know poppers great work you know the conjecture and refutations because you bring a new understanding a constructive theoretic understanding of knowledge and you have a parsimonious way of distinguishing knowledge from information we've already talked about information as being this entity which has the

### 1h 8m

property of being able to be flipped and copied or in the case of quantum information theory some of those copies are impossible but what is knowledge and how is knowledge to be distinguished from any other kind of prosaic form of information uh yeah so this is um connected to this problem we were talking about earlier is that we don't have a theory of creativity or how we create knowledge well i don't think we have even a theory of knowledge that's the problem so we need in physics uh so so that's maybe the first starting point that we need to um to deal with and in constructive theory you can give some you know hints as to how you're going to be able to do that so that's the first starting point that we need to you you could do that because um you have this nice handle that on information that is uh you know you allow you know using constructive here allows you to uh describe information in terms of these physical systems that can contain it and it's uh their uh counterfactual properties

### 1h 9m

so this copyability and permutability of states and so on uh and then you can say well information knowledge is actually a special kind of special kind of information um so of this thing that can be embodied in these physical systems with the properties that i just said um with extra counterfactual properties and uh the extra counterfactual properties are the fact that this kind of information um has the ability to uh effect to cause transformations on other physical systems and to retain the property of causing it again so this is um in a sense an idea of resilient information so it's a information that tends to to hang about and stay there and and sort of not evaporate very quickly over the relevant time scales of a given dynamical system but it just stays there and it's almost like an invariant property um and this this um this entity

### 1h 10m

uh you can you can describe it in terms of these ability to stay instantiated in physical systems which is a counterfactual ability or a counterfactual property of the of the particular kind of information we're talking about and it's nice because it seems to me this um decouples knowledge from subjects uh knowing subjects and so in a way this uh you know of course is rooted into these ideas of of uh epistemological ideas of karl poppers and david's ideas as well and nicely decouples therefore the idea of knowledge from subjectivity and and things that are maybe one of the reasons why this idea of um the problem of having a physical theory of knowledge isn't taken that seriously by physicists because they're usually repelled by anything that sounds um you know even remotely subjective whereas with this way of thinking about it you can actually bring it closer to physics and it's very much in line also with view with ways of

### 1h 11m

thinking about knowledge in biology um or in fact information that's related to the physical world in biology because of course parts of the genome are some collections of genes doing sunshade knowledge in this way because they have this property of of you know imparting you know giving instructions to the cell about what to do as well as also they have the ability if they are successful in a given environment to perpetuate themselves through various uh you know generations and so in that sense uh it's nicely friendly also towards biology this this idea of knowledge and so we're hoping that this can be used uh to also further our understanding of things like the origin of life the early life uh stages where we still maybe don't have a you know as deep an understanding of what happened as we do say in the case of uh evolution where we already know you know that that was theory works but somehow the early

### 1h 12m

stages from the very beginning to to when evolution can get started there are some some discussions about how this could have happened and i think hopefully this kind of knowledge this new notion of knowledge can help in clarifying some of these aspects it's one of the most exciting areas of constructive theory the linking of biology epistemology and physics one of the most powerful points that you make there very early on in the science of canon kant is how there are certain bacteria that essentially have gone unchanged for billions of years so you can look out into the physical environment see mountains see rocks and think ah there are resilient things that have been there geological time is just so long but in terms of what is truly resilient it's those dna strands in that primitive bacteria outlast all of them i mean we find archaea that perhaps stretch back that three and a half billion years no mountain ranges lasted that long no rock has lasted that long and yet we have this deep

### 1h 13m

physical problem how is it that this thing has been so resilient for so long well it's the knowledge but what does that mean how how in fact is it maintaining itself in that environment it's a curious thing that for the overwhelming majority of the evolution of life on earth bacteria was doing nothing dna was actually doing nothing sitting there rather inert not evolving not changing but presumably there would have been environmental selection pressures but nothing was happening yeah it's very interesting i think these questions are are interesting also going back to this uh you know risk of technology and so on these questions are relevant because if if we could have an understanding of knowledge that is rooted within physics and also theoretical biology um we could then tackle this issue of how do we create knowledge how is it that that knowledge comes into the world uh in a

### 1h 14m

more uh i would say scientific and and uh way that that would allow us to also make progress maybe in this other sector of sort of finding ways of creating agis uh and so on so i'm hoping this will happen and just one final question before we finish up not to do with constructive theory but to do with you've proposed with some colleagues an experiment for testing general relativity in the the under the quantum regime can you speak a little bit about that i think it's a rather unique approach to a possible experiment and and what are the hold-ups and actually doing this experiment yeah so this is a work that i've been doing with uh vladko vedril who is working here in oxford and it's actually an example of an application of constructive theories principles in an area where we don't have a settled dynamical law with which to make predictions so as as

### 1h 15m

i think everyone knows now the you know the way we should describe gravity is basically with einstein's general relativity and this theory is classical in the sense that it does not have it doesn't permit quantum information right so it doesn't have quantum superpositions it doesn't have any of the features of quantum theory so gravity is a classical entity in this sense so it doesn't allow for superpositions whereas masses and energies can exist in superpositions of different values because that's what quantum theory says about particles with masses and also energies of these particles and so on and because anything with a energy mass gravitates there is a problem because then what happens when you have like gravity interacting with something that is capable of being in a superposition uh like quantum theory says and this problem has been around for a while uh it's already pointed out by many people

### 1h 16m

in the 50s even before i think feinman was the person whoroted the who maybe phrased it more clearly with this idea of just thinking what happens when you have a mass in a quantum superposition what does the gravitational field do with it and as a result of that lots of theories have been proposed so there are lots of dynamical models that have been proposed within the quantum gravity program however they haven't been tested and also they have problems conceptually and also the mathematical level so in a sense we are not really sure if we want to make a prediction about what does the gravitational field do when interacting with a quantum system we would know which model to choose because we have no idea of which one is the the most reliable one out of the ones we have and some of them don't work also in some regimes etc so I think

### 1h 17m

that's it. Thank you. I think what we realized with Vlatko is that we could use instead of forget dynamical laws for a second and think instead of principles right so that's what that's the beauty of principles they don't use like second law of thermodynamics like conservation of energy they don't use necessarily dynamics to to express themselves but they are general rules that you can apply even when you don't know what the dynamics is and so likewise constructive theories principles about the information theory have this feature so you can apply some of the theories some of the principles of constructive theory of information to this system where you have gravity interacting with a mass because both of them can be seen as approximate information media and just the quantum mass is also a quantum information medium so it has these extra properties and when you do that you can prove a nice result

### 1h 18m

which is basically a generalization of what we already know from quantum information but it allows you to talk about a system like gravity that may not obey quantum theory so it may not fit into quantum information itself that's why we need the principles of constructive theory and this this result says something like this that if you have a system for example like gravity that is capable of interacting with two other quantum systems and and create entanglement between these two systems then itself this system itself must have some quantum features so it's a it's like a statement of you know saying that you've got a channel you have a system that has some channel capacity and if you can use it as a channel to create entanglement between two systems that you know can get entangled like quantum masses then you you're proving something about that channel and the fact that it has to be quantum itself so you're not really measuring anything on that system

so that's why it's powerful this idea because you don't have to measure anything about gravity itself which is difficult that's what is very difficult to do because you need very high energies to do anything with gravity because it's a very weak type of interaction but you can indirectly check whether it's quantum by seeing whether it can do it can create this entanglement between masses so does that mean it would rule out the notion that gravity is classical yes so if you could do this experiment in a laboratory you would rule out the possibility that yes you would rule out the possibility that gravity is described by classical theory like general relativity so it would mean that general relativity has to be changed in one of the ways that we thought with quantum gravity or maybe with a different way depending on where you're going but I think it has to be modified in in to accommodate quantum features something that has been doubted by many I think most famously I think

Penrose had this view that somehow gravity would cause quantum systems to collapse at a certain scale and therefore would end up you know he would bet on the on the classicality of gravity winning over the quantumness of classical or quantum systems whereas if we could perform this experiment and see entanglement this would be a completely mind-blowing thing because it would really be the first confirmation that well the first refutation of Einstein's general relativity as a a classical theory and also a corroboration of these programs for quantum gravity for quantizing gravity that haven't so far had any experimental or observational support and the cool thing about this is that you can do this in a laboratory so you don't have to go at very high energies like you know use things like particle accelerators or consider experiments that involve early universe type considerations and so on you you can you can do this in in a

relatively low energies so this means that the general relativistic effects are not there yet so it's it's a very funny regime where you can you know go and check whether gravity is quantum without gravity behaving uh you know without the general atlantic features of gravity being relevant and and this is the thing that was found promising not just by us but also by by other people from the community of quantum gravity and it's nice that this was um if you like a you know the sort of um byproduct of thinking about stuff in this information theoretic way so that's in a way one one example of the power of principles why is it that they are so powerful because even if you you know even if you're just a pragmatist and you don't care about whether it was fundamental or not you don't care about the position that that some physicists have uh you know they prove useful

### 1h 22m

whether or not you think they're fundamental because when you don't know which dynamics you you need to use you can appeal to them and if you think that they are good principles like locality or the principle of some principles that are at the basis of information theory that anyone would would think is are good principles then you can rely on them to make some predictions and one of them is this prediction here and that's very exciting so we're really hoping that someone will bring us it's more scientific research and but we're really hoping that you know the the the the research that we do um is going to be very technical but also very us in the field of planetary wonders and it's it's going to be very interesting uh to talk with you and to talk to some of those uh scientists and and to talk with you and to talk with some of your colleagues and and do some of the work that's taking place outside of the data science world and and and do some of the work that's taking place outside of the data science world and and i don't know if we want to do it in anyway but i think everyone would do a good job and i think and the masses that you need to to generate this effect are slightly over

### 1h 23m

the current limitations for what we can superpose in a lab so I think it's something like 10 to minus 12 kilograms which is more or less the size of I mean if you want to have a sort of approximate way of thinking about it it's like a cell is has that weight the human cell maybe and we currently can superpose masses that are four orders of magnitude four or five orders of magnitude lower than that but the reason why this is promising is that we're not we don't need to go all the way to this particular number that's called Planck's mass which is 10 to minus 8 kilograms which is a huge object by quantum standards and we don't need to go all the way to this particular number that's called it would require a lot more effort and it's the usual value that people in quantum gravity thought would be relevant for seeing quantum effects in gravity whereas this idea shows you that you can in fact do this with lower

### 1h 24m

masses that are much closer to the experimental abilities we have at the moment so what I think this will happen is just a question of the funding because this requires obviously a long relatively long term project maybe it's five ten years and there are some teams in the world that have the expertise for this they just have to you know get on with it and decide to do it and and also we have to choose the right technology so it's a difficult experiment but it's not an impossible experiment which is what most people thought would be the case for for testing quantum gravity and that's why maybe part of the scientific community was a bit skeptical about this program of quantizing gravity because it just produced so far things that seem to have produced something that is not predictions that were very very far away from any experimental capability so in a sense some people started saying well if we can't observe it why even quote you know why would you bother

### 1h 25m

quantizing it which is an argument that i don't really agree with but it's nice to be able to actually give some experimental confirmation or support these to these theories out there also because we we don't know which theories is you know most of them have problems so somehow i guess maybe having some experimental way of looking into things would help us maybe having more um information about how to tweak these theories or change them all together and think of a different approach uh so yeah so i think the it will i think will happen and it's much closer to realization than than it was before but it requires um a number of of things and also an international collaboration probably because it requires expertise to be collected from different things around the world this is happening so you know i'm hoping in a few years time we can discuss how it went yes well thank you so much for your time kiara as i say again to people they really should go out and get a hold of the science of canon can't it's out there on audiobook format you can get it as a paperback be lovely as a as a hardback

### 1h 26m

gift for for christmas for anyone out there but where else uh can people find out information about your research and constructive theory in general so there is this uh constructor theory.org website that you you can find on our website at constructortheory.org or you can find uh on the internet there are lots of well number of didactic resources on constructor theory some videos uh some explanatory material as well for you know as an introduction and then you can also find information on my own personal website uh which is kisma.com okay thank you so much kiara and i hope to speak to you again soon yeah thank you so much great thank you if you'd like to support my work here at all that topcast go to www.bretthall.org here's the web page and there are links there to my patreon support pages or my paypal account where you can make a one-off donation until next time bye

### 1h 27m

uh Thank you for watching.
