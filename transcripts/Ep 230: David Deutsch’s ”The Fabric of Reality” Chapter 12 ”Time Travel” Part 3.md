Welcome to TopCast and to the unexpected part three discussing chapter 10 of the fabric of reality time travel. I say unexpected because as I got closer to the end I realized that things were becoming exponentially more interesting at least for me because David was elucidating how the four strands came together in particular epistemology is related to time travel. So how evolution, epistemology, computation and of course quantum physics come to be or physics more generally come to bear on this question of time travel which is surprising. Normally you'd think it's just a question of physics of course physics is what makes it possible but what are the effects upon or the effects of those other things on time travel? Well there are some and we're going to get to those and my central interest is now epistemology. It used to be physics but I kind of tend to think that these four strands actually are one strand in a sense ultimately all will be

### 1m

consumed by physics we will have a physics of biology we've already got a physics of computation quantum computation and we're ultimately going to have a physics of epistemology a physics of knowledge what it is possible and impossible to know for example we know some of that but not everything we want to understand the principles and David talks about the principles of epistemology and so hence this third part separate to the previous part which I thought was going to be the last but there was just so much to say. You may well wonder I certainly did when I first read the book and it's fair to wonder why all this talk about virtual reality machines and image generators here in this topic on time travel. It seems as if David Deutsch has an obsession with virtual reality but in fact if you read the chapter on virtual reality and have some understanding of the chapter on virtual reality you recognize that it's deeply embedded in our understanding of the church cheering

### 2m

Deutsch principle and quantum theory. What can be physically rendered in virtual reality tells us something about physics itself and all physical processes can be rendered in virtual reality but even given that why such a focus on virtual reality here in chapter 10? Well happily he explains exactly why and we're going to have a look at that in a moment. We're about to get to that so let me read the section that's relevant. David says quote arguments from virtual reality help in understanding time travel because the concept of virtual reality requires one to take counterfactual events seriously and therefore the multi-universe quantum concept of time seems natural when it is rendered in virtual reality end quote. There we hear again the seeds of a nascent constructor theory. The theory is about the reality of or the impact upon physics of counterfactual events. It is a physics

### 3m

of counterfactual events. The physics of the possible and impossible. Some possible things happen given the right knowledge let's say or given the outworks of the laws of physics and some things won't happen either because they're impossible according to the laws of physics or perhaps no one generates the knowledge. David continues by saying that past directed time travel is within the repertoire of a universe of time travel. The theory is about the reality of time travel. We learn that the idea of past directed time travel makes perfect sense. But that is not to say that it is necessarily physically achievable. After all faster than light travel perpetual motion machines and many other physical impossibilities are all possible in virtual reality. No amount of reasoning about virtual reality can prove that a given process is permitted by the laws of physics. Though it can prove that it is not. If we had reached the contrary conclusion it would be a lie. The theory is about the reality of time travel. It would have implied via the Turing Principle that time travel cannot occur physically.

### 4m

End quote. So if we could not render our past history in any virtual reality generator that would mean it was not a physically possible thing to do because Turing machines after all well a universal Turing machine anyway can compute anything physical that goes on. If it's a physical process the Turing machine a universal computer can simulate it in principle. Of course this idea that we wouldn't be able to simulate the past in some way would be a contradiction. Because the environment itself was physically rendered in the past so therefore it must have been computable. Either that or the Turing Principle would have been false. And what David is about to say at hints at how although if indeed we can travel to the past and the laws of physics allow us to whether or not we actually will is another story. We will get to that as well. But as we go on we as soon as we do travel to the past then we interact with that universe and therefore we

### 5m

change it. Which means we have not strictly traveled to our past. This is a sticking point for many people. Certainly a sticking point for me when I first read the book. It takes a couple of readings I think for that to sink in. Which is sometimes why I hear feedback that the time travel chapter is not necessarily people's favorite chapter in the book. They still like the chapter but they prefer other ones. But you know what I mean. It's a matter of time travel. And you rarely hear oh the time travel chapter is my favorite. But having done this series and reaching this point in the book I'm starting to regard the time travel chapter as in fact one of my favorite chapters. Precisely because of this idea that it teaches us not merely about time travel. It teaches about the multiverse. The nature of personhood. Something about knowledge. It teaches us about computation. It's a window on all the four strands as David says. And so getting to grips with chapter 10 means you're really getting to grips with the fabric of reality. Again let me

### 6m

just repeat what I was saying. David is about to hint at how if we can travel into our past then what we do is actually travel to a universe which is in our past but is not our past strictly speaking. Because our appearance there changes the past. Because if we physically appear there we're changing that universe. And that universe is not the one that we left from so to speak. It's not the one that is in our past anymore. After all our actual past was not interacted with by a traveler from the future. A copy of ourselves from the past. At least presumably if someone turns up in your room right now then I suppose it will be. But that hasn't happened yet. It's the point. That's the whole point. And there will always be copies of you. Fungible copies of you in the multiverse where no such future traveler has come back. Even if some

### 7m

future travelers sometimes do come back into your universe right now. This is getting ahead of myself. But I'm going to repeat that kind of thing again and again throughout this episode so that it sinks in. And this is not to cast aspersions on the viewer or the listener. It is a subtle point. At least I think it is anyway. I might just be a bit slow. David goes on to say quote so what do our positive conclusions about virtual reality time travel tell us about physics. They tell us what time travel would look like if it did occur. They tell us that past directed time travel would inevitably be a process set in several interacting and interconnected universes. In that process the participants would in general travel from one universe to another whenever they traveled in time. The precise ways in which the universes were connected would depend. Among other things on the participants state of mind. So for time travel to be physically possible

### 8m

it is necessary for there to be a multiverse. And it is necessary that the physical laws governing the multiverse be such that in the presence of a time machine and potential time travelers the universe has become interconnected in the way I have described and not in any other way. For example if I am not going to use a time machine come what may there are no time traveling versions of me must appear in my snapshot. That is no universes in which versions of me do use a time machine can become connected to my universe. End quote. Pausing there. A little reflection. That is an interesting point about the nature of personhood. I love this sort of stuff and thinking to myself again thought experiments about what it means for versions of me. Presumably even if you are definitely determined not to use a time machine come what may to what

### 9m

extent to all versions of you do that thing. Well all the versions of you that don't get into the time machine they are you and they stay the same. Or do they? Some of them differentiate and go off and do different things. Some have coffee some have tea. You presumably only have coffee and not tea. And both sets of you classes of you however you want to describe those two versions of you many fungible instances of each don't get into the time machine. But going back to the moment before you make the choice about whether or not to use a time machine and you and a whole bunch of versions of you don't use a time machine. Some versions of you nevertheless do decide to get into the time machine even though you were determined not to. So this gets into this nature of I don't want to use a time machine. I don't want to use a time machine. I don't want to use a time machine. What does it mean to be you? Well it's got to do with consciousness of course. And so

### 10m

if you have the conscious experience of being determined not to get into the time machine you don't get into the time machine then that's a version of you. If you are determined not to and yet for whatever reason you change your mind. Okay so this come what may thing you can't predict the future growth of knowledge. You can't predict the future growth of knowledge. So it doesn't matter about this come what may proviso. Someone might shove you into a time machine. Any number of things you might get swallowed into one if it's a black hole type time machine that David will talk about later on. Or come what may you might just find out that the only way to save the world is to get into the time machine. And so you know you can change your mind. You can't predict the future growth of knowledge. You have free will. So come what may has an effect upon this idea of personhood because you have choice. Nevertheless even being committed to this come what may. Okay so enough of me quibbling with that. Let's keep on going. David says quote if I am definitely

### 11m

going to use the time machine then my universe must become connected to another universe in which I also definitely use it. And if I am going to try to enact a paradox then as we have seen my universe must become connected with another one in which a copy of me has the same intention as I do. But by carrying out that intention ends up behaving differently from me. Pausing there. Just my reflection also on this. And again I'm kind of repeating myself a little bit but he's just said there. David has just said my universe must become connected with another one in which a copy of me has the same intention as I do. But by carrying out that intention ends up behaving differently from me. Okay so how is that possible? How is it possible that if you have the same intention. Okay all these copies have the same intention as you. But although they carry out the intention they behave differently from you. So if I have the same intention as you. But although they behave differently from you. Well precisely for the reasons that I alluded to earlier. Because

### 12m

there exist fungible instances of you to use the language of the beginning and infinity. Okay identical copies of you are sitting there right now. And if you've got the intention to do something like you use a time machine as you sit there now. If there happened to be a time machine in your room okay which is connected to the past in some way. You might intend to get into the time machine and you do so. But copies of you. Which then my argument is cease to become you. Do something else. That's why I say they're no longer you. So as soon as they do something else and they're conscious of something else. So therefore they're not you. Copies of you that are not fungible with you are no longer you. In any strict sense. They're just a copy of you. Okay fungible instances are also copies of you. But they're perfectly identical in all respects in the same time and space as you. The ones that are in different times are not technically you. They were you or they will be you. Okay that's a separate issue. How on earth could you have the

### 13m

intention of getting into a time machine though but not get into the time machine. Behave differently as David says. There's a million and one ways in which that could happen. You could intend to get into the time machine but a copy of you drops dead. That would be one thing. So you still get into the time machine and the other copy of you that intends to get into the time machine doesn't for that reason. Or could be knocked out of the way and prevented from getting into the time machine. At least at that exact time as you. Or you intend to do so but you get a phone call or some copies of you get a phone call. All of these things are possible. Anything's possible. You could intend to do so or copies of you can intend to do so and spontaneously turn into a flock of butterflies and fly away. These things are all consistent with the laws of physics. Remember the laws of quantum theory allow for these exceedingly improbable things to happen. You will never observe these things. These highly unlikely coincidences. The universe in which

### 14m

you occupy is approximately classical in that sense at the emergent level. However, however, however, it's chance of one in ten to the power of you know a hundred or whatever the number is you want to pick. Versions of you do in fact see something highly improbable happening. The flock of butterflies thing. I know this is where people get off the bus with me. Okay it's like no I refuse to listen to this. But you remember that when I say things like that as David talks about you know cups of tea spontaneously turning into top hats out of which a rabbit jumps or you know all the oceans of the world suddenly evaporating or the sun going supernova because everything heads towards the center or you turning into a flock of butterflies or birds or something else equally improbable. Those things happen so rarely one may as well say they never happen in your universe or will be part of your timeline even though they are

### 15m

part of the multiverse somewhere or other. Okay it happens in physical reality somewhere. You should not expect it to ever happen to you. As David says in the very next sentence quote remarkably all this is precisely what quantum theory does predict. In short the result is that if pathways into the past do exist travelers on them are free to interact with their environment in just the same way as they could if the pathways did not lead into the past. In no case does time travel become inconsistent or impose special constraints on time traveler's behavior. That leads us with the question whether it is physically possible for pathways into the past to exist. This question has been the subject of much research and is still highly controversial. The usual starting point is a set of equations which form the predictive basis of the equation. The question is whether it is physically possible for pathways into the past to exist. of Einstein's general theory of relativity currently our best theory of space and time.

### 16m

These equations known as Einstein's equations have many solutions each describing a possible four-dimensional configuration of space time and gravity. Einstein's equations certainly permit the existence of pathways into the past. Many solutions with that property have been discovered end quote. Now here is where we get into some really interesting physics for the physics boffins out there. The most famous of these sets of solutions about the possibility of traveling into the past as permitted by general relativity were in fact discovered by Kurt Gödel that we have talked about many times before on TopCast usually with respect to his famous incompleteness theorems that not all true statements that can be talked about in mathematics have proofs. So what we've discovered is that in math it's not just that the requirements are not true or that there are guarantees of that. It's that not all true statements that can be talked about in mathematics have proofs. For instance if we were to use a problem that can be campoval that means eucalyptus equations and if we were to equate these equations into Linkedاد that resto dont you think we're going to get that positive and positive and social fluency test how we're all cutting our way right and sweaty again. The fact that we're not okay so there's some things that cannot possibly be known in mathematics which is to say you can't

### 17m

find a proof for them you can't know what the proof is if the laws of physics are different you might be able to know the proof okay that's the thing that girdle figured out which leads to what david deutsch says in this very book the fabric of reality where he talks about how therefore mathematics must always remain a creative enterprise it's not a simply mechanical one where you can just always calculate your way starting with a bunch of axioms to reach conclusions so the story with girdle and these solutions you look up the girdle metric if you're interested in this the girdle metric the solutions these closed time like curves found by girdle i think also he figured out that the entire universe itself could be rotating and allow for this possibility of time travel these were done by or found by girdle basically just for the fun of it which shows you what a remarkable mathematician he was it's like ah just for fun i will just prove that time travel

### 18m

is possible given einstein's theory of general relativity equations let me find a bunch of solutions which permit time travel into the past he did this why did he do this so he did this for einstein's 70th birthday many people contributed the gifts to einstein for his 70th birthday most people contributed the gifts to einstein for his 70th birthday most people contributed the gifts to people did the usual thing but a lot of intellectuals contributed intellectual gifts and Kurt Gödel being a friend of Albert Einstein for his 70th birthday wrote down these solutions he found Gödel being Gödel found solutions to Einstein's field equations that showed the whole universe might spin or that closed time like curves in other words paths into the past could exist incidentally Sam Kuypers he organized for David Deutsch's 70th birthday a group of people to contribute in a similar way to David's birthday you can see the contributions here I'll put it up

### 19m

on the screen go to this website here now there are people who did things kind of in the mold of Gödel but not exactly to the same degree I would say to the same degree I suppose would be something like building building a quantum a universal quantum computer or perhaps providing the the the more detailed plans to want something like that anyway let's see the contributions here i i was one of the people that didn't do anything hugely intellectual i just gave well wishes via a video on how david has personally inspired me and i think changed the world in many ways but others who know a lot more physics mathematics and philosophy than i do provided deeply intellectual gifts musings on constructor theory or quantum theory and physics generally that were speculative for david's birthday so do take a look at this this just happened to this idea of um closed time like

### 20m

curves and the girdle metric and einstein's 70th birthday just reminded me of this but otherwise it's got absolutely nothing to do with chapter 12 time travel here so let me get back to that now so what do people think about girdle solutions and other solutions by the way you know he wasn't the only one many people found solutions that allow or permit this time travel into the past what have people said about this given that they these other physicists mathematicians think in terms of single universe models of physical reality and therefore allow for things like the grandfather paradox and then have a problem with that well what do they do about that well david goes on to say quote until recently the accepted practice has been to systematically ignore such solutions but this has not been for any reason arising from within the theory nor from any argument within physics at all it has been because physicists were under the impression that time travel would lead to paradoxes and that such solutions of einstein's equations must therefore be

### 21m

unphysical this arbitrary second guessing is reminiscent of what happened in the early years of general relativity when the solutions describing the big bang and an expanding universe were rejected by einstein himself he tried to change the equation so that they would describe a static universe instead later he referred to this as the biggest mistake of his life and the expansion was verified experimentally by the american astronomer edwin hubble end quote pausing there yes so in order to have a static universe the entire entirety of physical reality would have to be sitting on the ground and the expansion would have to be the edge of a knife essentially it would be ridiculous for it to be balanced in such a way so that is why the equations of einstein describe a dynamic universe it should either be expanding or contracting one or the other and so the logic went well it can't be contracting because it

### 22m

long ago would have collapsed into a single point but then again of course one would presume that you also don't know how big the universe is or do you know how big the universe is or do you know how big the universe is do you but if but if einstein had the courage of his convictions and being einstein you would think well shouldn't he after all this is the guy who challenged newton successfully reinvented basically all of mechanics the the the mathematics of motion the physics of motion and time and space and all that kind of stuff revolutionized physics in other words and had a deep hand in the formation of quantum theory as well the photoelectric effect among other things photons the nature of light and all that stuff and a whole lot more and and and tried to unify of course quantum theory and general relativity so why this thing was the one thing where he held back and went well okay although my equations do

### 23m

describe a dynamic universe i know the universe is static i i suppose who knows what the social pressure was on him but he didn't seem like a person who was particularly concerned about social pressure maybe he was just being a little too humble and thought he didn't know enough about astronomy and cosmology in order to be able to say well my physics describes an expanding universe therefore go and look for one so it took hubble the astronomer to point telescopes at the sky notice that the galaxies were red shifted which is now known as the hubble expansion a a a piece of evidence explained by the big bang theory the expanding universe theory the other bits of evidence recall are also the big bang theory the heat left over from the big bang the universe is bathed in a 2.7 kelvin temperature everywhere at almost all points okay some places are hotter like here where we are on the earth and the sun and stars and that but those places are the exception the rule is relatively empty space

### 24m

with a temperature of 2.7 kelvin and then also the ratio of hydrogen to helium and other elements is explained by that's evidence of the big bang or i prefer to say that is explained by the big bang and also the fact the night sky is dark won't get into it all now but anyway hubble was the first one to figure out hey the universe uh the galaxies lots of galaxies have redshift we can't possibly be in a special place in the universe it's not like we're at the center of the universe every galaxy almost every galaxy a few are gravitationally bound to us like the andromeda galaxy for example is heading towards us we're heading towards it they're mutually attracted to each other but otherwise the galaxies are rushing away from each other and hubble was the first to find this in fact the history is rather complicated there were other astronomers involved as well but hubble rightly deserves the main credit for this and that's why you know einstein went you know head to hand i suppose just like that famous picture of popper um what on earth was i thinking of course

### 25m

i i my equation said the universe was expanding why didn't i just say the universe was expanding astronomers were expanding the universe was expanding the universe was expanding the universe was expanding astronomers go look for evidence that the universe is expanding indeed they did and so then the evidence at first this redshift was a problem but a problem that was solved by theory solved by the good explanation david goes on to say quote for many years also the solutions obtained by the german astronomer carl schwarzschild which were the first to describe black holes were mistakenly rejected as unphysical they described counterintuitive phenomena such as a really unphysical phenomenon and they described counterintuitive phenomena such as a really region from which it is in principle impossible to escape and gravitational forces becoming infinite at the black hole center the prevailing view nowadays is that black holes do exist and do have the properties predicted by einstein's equations taken literally einstein's equations predict that travel into the past would be possible in the vicinity of massive spinning

### 26m

objects such as black holes if they spun fast enough and in certain other situations but many physicists doubt that these predictions are realistic pausing there my reflection on that so many physicists today doubt that spinning black holes are realistic so many physicists doubted that the universe was expanding back when einstein's equations first predicted that it should be so kind of who cares doesn't really matter if it's not prohibited strictly by the the laws of physics, then it's possible. Okay, so it doesn't really matter what physicists think is realistic or not. It depends upon what the laws of physics say. And the very next sentence where David says, quote, no sufficiently rapidly spinning black holes are known, end quote, is also

### 27m

not helpful. I mean, absence of evidence, as people say, absence of evidence is, of course, not evidence of absence. So who knows? Black holes are very well studied theoretically, but not very much experimentally. It was only in the last decade or so that we even had visual images of black holes, at least the accretion disks, you know, stuff falling into black holes and so on, you know. This famous photo. So, yeah, who knows what we will find? Who knows what we'll find? It's certainly the case that neutron stars spin extremely rapidly, very, very rapidly, because when you get a supernova, because of conservation of angular momentum, when you have a supernova, you can have very, very, very rapidly spinning neutron stars called pulsars. So, you know, these things can be 10 kilometers in diameter or something,

### 28m

but they don't spin very rapidly. They can spin thousands of times per second or faster. So why this couldn't also be true of black holes, I don't know. I'm not enough of a particle or theoretical physicist to know that there's any reason why. But black holes, by the way, they're more akin to subatomic particles properly considered than they are to something like neutron stars, even though both black holes and neutron stars can be the end state of regular stars like the sun. Well, in fact, not regular stars like the sun. Let me correct myself. Regular stars like the sun end up as white dwarfs. But if you have a much more massive star than the sun, once they go supernova, a few different things can happen. Two things that can happen include neutron star and black hole. So the end point of stars can lead to other things that are kind of like stars. In fact, they're not. They're dead stars. White dwarf is a dead star. Neutron star is a dead star.

### 29m

In other words, fusion is not still happening inside of those objects. Black hole, end point of a star, but not really at all like a star. It's so tiny that, you know, it can fit inside of an atom. And it only has very simple properties as well. You can't talk about the volume of a black hole, for example, except to say that it's zero and the density is infinite. And if it's rotating, maybe it's spinning in a way that is more like what an electron would do. Which is to have spin, which isn't actually like the rotation of a sphere. This gets complicated. And black holes are one of the windows into the unification, therefore, of quantum theory and general relativity. Precisely because these quantum effects apply to things noticeable, observable, easily observable, become large and important factors in things that are much,

### 30m

much smaller. Even though quantum theory, of course, describes everything that exists, it's a universal theory. It describes the multiverse. It describes the largest physical structure known. In other words, all of physical reality, the multiverse. The mysterious parts of quantum theory, which are not noticeable in day-to-day life as we walk around, because our universe is approximately classical, the things that are not at all classical, such as very, very small objects, includes things like black holes, predicted by general relativity, governed by quantum theory, governed by both. And so, therefore, you need both theories in order to understand these things, which is why Stephen Hawking, the genius that he was, was able to figure out things like black holes evaporate, because he was able to, in a sense, unify at least part, part of general relativity and quantum theory. Or at least, again, using this word, a window on the

### 31m

problem of unifying quantum theory and general relativity, the information paradoxes and so on that are involved with black holes. Going back to the book, David has just said, no sufficiently rapidly spinning black holes are known. We should insert the word yet there. Anyway, no sufficiently rapidly spinning black holes are known, and it has been argued inconclusively that it might be impossible to spin one up artificially, because any rapidly spinning material, that one fired in, might be thrown off. And be unable to enter the black hole, end quote. But as I say, at the end of their lives, stars can leave behind objects that are spinning extremely fast. One such is the neutron star. And the smaller, in radius, the thing happens to be, the faster it tends to spin, because of this law, conservation of angular momentum, that is operating. When big clouds of stuff, large objects, become smaller objects.

### 32m

Now, the conservation of angular momentum, certainly ice skaters do. But if we're worried about this question of, you know, can we artificially spin a black hole? Maybe we don't need to. Maybe we don't need to, because they're naturally spinning. But let's say, let's say that we wanted to. Well, if we're speculating on what it's, you know, possible to do and not possible to do, because the laws of physics don't do it, the problem here is really matter, okay? The problem is one with matter, not with, which is governed by quantum theory, not, you know, not so much, general, general relativity and quantum theory govern both. Obviously, they govern both. But if we're talking about particles and what it's possible to do with particles, and we're going to speculate, then if you consider something like wormholes, okay, wormholes are also a place in which you might be able to get, and they're speculative, but a place in which you might get the possibility of closed time-like curves, you could have a wormhole into the past. The problem there is that in order to keep the thing open,

### 33m

and David will mention this without mentioning the word wormhole, unless you've got exotic matter, so it is said, to build things with, to keep the wormhole open, then the thing will collapse. But what if we consider exotic matter that might actually be out there? Like, what makes a quark? What makes an electron? Well, we don't know. We assume they're fundamental, but there might be something inside of those. Imagine you could, you know, use whatever is making up leptons, namely things like electrons, if you could pull the electron apart, whatever the building blocks are that make up an electron, maybe that's the exotic matter that you need. So assume you could, you know, throw that kind of matter into a black hole in order to increase its rotational momentum and get it to spin. I don't know. I don't know. But if we're going to speculate, let's speculate. Anyway, David goes on granting people this idea that it might not be possible in order to

### 34m

generate a, time machine this way. He says, quote, the skeptics may be right, but insofar as their reluctance to accept the possibility of time travel is rooted in a belief that it leads to paradoxes, it is unjustified. Even when Einstein's equations have become more fully understood, they will not provide conclusive answers on the subject of time travel. The general theory of relativity predates quantum theory, and it is not wholly compatible with it. No one has yet succeeded in formulating a satisfactory quantum version, a quantum theory, of gravity. Yet, from the arguments I have given, quantum effects would be dominant in time-traveling situations. Typical candidate versions of a quantum theory of gravity not only allow past-directed connections to exist in the multiverse, they predict that such connections are continually forming and breaking spontaneously. This is happening throughout space and time, but only on a

### 35m

sub-microscopic scale. Typical way formed by these effects is about 10 to the power of 35 meters across, remains open for one plank time, about 10 to the power of minus 43 seconds, and therefore reaches only about one plank time into the past. End quote. Firstly, can you hear that snoring sound? That's my cat. It's asleep off to the side there. So, the typical pathway into the past, according to quantum theory, will only be about 10 to the power of minus 35 meters in diameter, for one to fit through, and also will only reach back into the past about 10 to the power of minus 43 seconds. So, you're telling me there's a chance? Yeah! David goes on to say, quote, future-directed time travel, which essentially requires only efficient rockets,

### 36m

on the moderately distant but confidently foreseeable technological horizon. Past-directed time travel, which requires the manipulation of black holes or some similarly violent gravitational disruption of the fabric of space and time, will be practicable only in the remote future, if at all. End quote. Pausing there, let's reflect upon this for a moment. We are all always traveling into the future, so to speak, but the faster we move, then the faster we move. So, the faster we move, the faster we move. So, the faster we move, then the slower do clocks outside of our particular frame of reference tick. And so, if we travel away somewhere very, very fast and then turn around and come back, this is the famous twin paradox, not a paradox actually, this twin effect, where you will come back much, much younger than the people you have left behind because of relativistic effects. So, the only problem therein is if you go fast enough, fall long enough, and then return to your future. So, the only problem therein is if you go

### 37m

fast enough, fall long enough, and then return to your future. So, the only problem therein is if you go starting point, you may well find that everyone and everything you ever cared about has long since passed away, possibly. So, you might be ending up in a future where you don't want to be and you'd like to get back to the place where you were, but in order to have that, then you'll need a time machine, not just a very efficient rocket. And David goes on to say, quote, at present, we know of nothing in the laws of physics that rules out past directed time travel. On the contrary, they make it plausible. That time travel is possible. Future discoveries in fundamental physics may change this. It may be discovered that quantum fluctuations in space and time become overwhelmingly strong near time machines and effectively seal off their entrances. Stephen Hawking, for one, has argued that some calculations of his make this likely, but his argument is inconclusive, end quote. I'm just pausing here because in the next section that I'm about to read, the next paragraph, we get a hint of what is to come in the beginning of infinity. In the fabric of reality, there's a lot of these

### 38m

kind of nuggets that we find that David fleshes out in the beginning of infinity. They're kind of almost throwaway lines here in the fabric of reality, and they become important themes throughout the beginning of infinity. This is a key, by the way, that when you encounter great thinkers, you find this in Popper, and I've got the sense, sometimes, that David himself has perhaps used this technique, that in, and Popper himself used this technique, so it's not just David. Popper looks to the philosophers that have gone before and finds things in what they say and expands upon them, or finds a problem and finds the solution or creates the solution to the problem. David finds parts of Karl Popper's philosophy, for example, explanations. Karl Popper talks about explanations a lot, but he doesn't make a huge deal about what explanations are. He doesn't explore that point

### 39m

very much. David turns it into a deep part of the Popperian epistemology, even though Popper didn't find it. It's in that school of philosophy, for want of another word, part of critical rationalism. I just prefer to call it epistemology, so this notion of explanations being hard to vary, and the falsifiability of, a scientific explanation being just one part of the way in which a theory qualifies as being scientific, but it's not the only way. So you can find these parts of great thinkers' philosophies and expand upon them and contribute yourself. Now here, David's doing it with himself, I get the sense, because here we have a throwaway line, seemingly a throwaway line. It's an important part of the fabric of reality, but it becomes a, a huge theme of the beginning of infinity. What am I talking about? Well, let's go.

### 40m

So Stephen Hawking has just argued that some of his calculations make this likely, this idea of quantum fluctuations near time machines causing issues. David goes on to say, quote, or some hitherto unknown phenomenon may rule out past-directed time travel or provide a new and easier method of achieving it. David goes on to say, quote, one cannot predict the future growth of knowledge. But if the future development of fundamental physics continues to allow time travel in principle, then its practical attainment will surely become a mere technological problem that will eventually be solved, end quote. That's the nugget I'm talking about here. That is the sentence that becomes a theme in the beginning of infinity. One cannot predict the future growth of knowledge. It's also a part of, Karl Popper's philosophy as well. But David Deutsch turns it into a deep aspect of the way

### 41m

in which we delineate between optimism and pessimism, the ability to predict versus prophesy, and therefore our capacity to know the future. When so many intellectuals tell us they know the future, and in fact, they're just prophesying, they're, ignoring the future growth of knowledge. And as David says there, one cannot predict the future growth of knowledge. Here, in the fabric of reality, yeah, it's there, it's a part of the four strands, so to speak, but it's not focused on to the degree that it is in the beginning of infinity. Let's keep going. David writes, quote, because no time machine provides pathways to times earlier than the moment at which it came into existence, and because of the way in which quantum theory, and quantum physics, and quantum physics, and quantum physics, and quantum says that universes are interconnected, there are some limits to what we can expect to learn

### 42m

by using time machines. Once we have built one, but not before, we may expect visitors, or at least messages from the future to emerge from it. End quote. Just pausing there because as David will come to, he says, we might expect visitors from the future, or messages, to come from time machines. once we've built them. Not quite. After all, aliens might have built time machines. They might have built time machines millions of years ago. And if we can get a hold of those, or if they lend them to us, we might be able to travel to our past. There's that. Or naturally occurring time machines. If there is a rapidly spinning black hole somewhere near us that has been around since, who knows, billions of years somewhere in the Milky Way galaxy or whatever, then maybe we can use that to travel into our past as well.

### 43m

So perhaps we don't need to build the time machine. It may be naturally occurring, or some other civilization may have built it. Of course, really, time machines are likely going to be a technology, if they exist at all, that we will have to create ourselves. And David's going to come to the creation of knowledge and how it's related here to time machines almost presently. Anyway. Let's keep going. David goes on to say, having just talked about visitors from the future or messages coming from the future through the time machines, quote, What will they tell us? One thing they will certainly not tell us is news of our own future. The deterministic nightmare of the prophecy of an inescapable future doom brought about in spite of, or perhaps as the very consequence of, our attempts to avoid it is the stuff of myth and science fiction only. Visitors from the future cannot know our future any more than we can,

### 44m

for they did not come from there. Pausing there, my reflection. This is the section that I said I was going to repeat over and over again, as I said not too long ago. I said I was going to repeat that and how to solve this. Let's just say that again very quickly. Visitors from the future. Cannot know our future any more than we can, for they did not come from there. Now, I admit, I didn't get that the first time I read this. Now, what on earth is David talking about? Again, if the time machine has been built, we've built this time machine, and out of the time machine steps you, yourself, then in what sense, if it's a real time machine,

### 45m

hasn't the visitor from the future come from your future? What's he talking about? Either the time machine is possible or it's not possible, in which case, if it is possible, then the travellers are coming from the future. Yes, they're coming from the future. They're coming from a future. It's just not your future. It's not your future. Why isn't it your future? That's because they have come from, a future, where in their past, so let's say it's a copy of you, in their past, no time travellers from the future came. So let me say it again. I know I'm repeating myself, but because I struggled with this when I first read it. Admittedly, that was in 1997, so it's some time ago now, but I do remember struggling with this chapter. And as I say, other people have told me it's not their favourite chapter. And it wasn't my favourite chapter when I first read the book.

### 46m

But now, it is one of my favourite chapters. And I think that's because it has taken me understanding the beginning of infinity to a higher degree of accuracy, so that in retrospect, when I go back to the fabric of reality, now I understand this chapter more, having read the multiverse, the multiverse chapter over and again in the beginning of infinity. It helps me to understand this. So, what I've just said is that travellers from the future, even if they're you, you, you know, your oldest self, are not coming from your future. They're just coming from a future, not your future. Time travellers from the future, if they appear around us now, do not come from our future. And that's because, in their past, quite possibly,

### 47m

they were not visited. Now, yesterday, you were not visited by anyone from the future. I was not visited by anyone from the future. Nor was I, this morning, visited by anyone from the future. Now, imagine, imagine, that someone does go back into my past, to yesterday, and visits me yesterday. Well, I've got no memory of that. But they could still do it. In theory. It's just that it won't be my past, technically. It'll be a copy of me. I know this gets a little confusing. But, just consider, again, as you sit there, as you're sitting wherever you are, or listening, wherever you're listening to this, that your future self, in a sense, your future self, at the age of, let's say, 150, let's say they come back in time, they visit you. At some point, this evening, a future you, at age 150,

### 48m

they come back to you, and they say to you, relax, relax. You're going to live until you're 150 years old, at least 150 years old. Because I am you from the future, and I'm telling you that you live until 150. So, however old you are now, just relax because you've got a lot longer to live. But, but, but, you can ask, this 150-year-old version of you, you can say to them, hold on, you're 150 and you're coming back to tell me, now, at whatever age you happen to be, that you're from the future. Now, therefore, doesn't that mean that you, the 150-year-old version of yourself, was visited in your past by a copy of yourself, at the age at which you are now? What if they say no? What if they say, no, I wasn't visited by a copy of me when, you know, like, for example, here I am sitting here,

### 49m

as I am Brett Hall, in my 40s. I was not, I've not yet been visited by someone, by a copy of myself who is 150 years old. And so, if, when I get to 150, I go back and visit myself at the age I am now, I would have to answer no to the question if I was to ask myself, so, were you visited by a 150-year-old version of yourself? I'd have to say no, because I wasn't, I haven't been, I haven't been so far. Therefore, that person from the future is not going into their past, not their past specifically, because in their past, strictly speaking, they never got visited. Now, on the other hand, if you were to ask your future self the question, so, when you were my age, OK, you're 150 now, you stepped out of the time machine, and you say to the person, were you visited at your age by someone, by a version of yourself who was 150 years old,

### 50m

if they say yes to that question, the same argument actually still applies to the visitor. Among other things, nothing guarantees that they must behave exactly as their visitor had. That would take perfect memory, exactly the same behaviour, exactly the same memories, exactly the same speech, everything goes on. They have to behave exactly the same way and more besides. Each time a visitor comes from the future to the present, wherever you are now, they will change their past, but it won't be their past. It's a different past. How often can that happen? Well, although there is, in theory, an upper bound, it's a very, very high upper bound, and so you can have many, many instances of you coming from the future back to visit you, and each time they do, they're going to change the past,

### 51m

so to speak, but not their past, just your future. I know this is confusing, but it raises the question, what if when your future self from age 150 turns up tomorrow, you know, on your doorstep or whatever, knocks on your door in order to tell you something about, for example, how to live until you're 150, or not to worry that you're not going to die until 150, they knock on your door tomorrow, fully expecting to deliver this good news to you or to deliver the special knowledge about how to survive until 150, they knock on your door tomorrow, but you're not there. And the reason you're not there tomorrow is because, let's say, for example, among many things that could possibly happen, a version of you who is 200 years old comes some point tonight, not tomorrow, some point tonight,

### 52m

in order to get to you before the person who is 150 gets to you, in order to say to you, look, a version of you from age 150 is going to turn up tomorrow, and they're going to deliver you a message about how to survive until you're 150. But I'm here to warn you, this is the 200-year-old version of yourself, to avoid that person at all costs, because whatever they're going to say to you is going to cause your death or going to cause an accident or is going to cause something terrible to happen. And so here I am, you know, from your age at 200, to warn you about the version of you as 150 coming back in time in order to deliver you information, which, although they've got the best of intentions to try and get you to survive until 150, is actually going to cause, you know, death and destruction on a global scale or something like that. If that person at 150 is trying to deliver you the secret to living to 150,

### 53m

but the person who is 200 years old knows that treatment will kill you at age 180 or will cause the death of your loved ones or something like that. Okay, I think I'll stop there because I'm becoming... very swiftly the author of a bad science fiction novel myself here. So we'll leave it there in terms of that. But you get the point, right? You get the point that the multiverse allows for this travel into the past. However, however, it's not strictly speaking travel into your past. It's just the past. It's just a past. So the people that travel from... the future can come and visit you, but they're not coming to their past, strictly speaking, and they're not coming from your future either.

### 54m

They're travelling to universes which are in their past and universes which are in your future. I know, the language is sort of struggling to keep up with this. But David goes on to say, quote, but they can tell us about the future of their universe whose past was identically... identical to ours. They can bring taped news and current affairs programs and newspapers with dates starting from tomorrow and onwards. If their society made some mistaken decision which led to disaster, they can warn us of it. We may or may not follow their advice. If we follow it, we may avoid the disaster. There can be no guarantees. We may find that the result is even worse than what happened to them, end quote. As I said, in a sense, the point here is, that there's no paradox. You go back in time and you cannot, strictly speaking, kill yourself or kill your grandfather.

### 55m

You can merely kill a copy of yourself at some age, okay, at some age in your past, but it's not going to be you, it's a copy of you. After all, you lived, you're alive. You can't kill the past version of yourself, just copies of you. And you can't kill... You can't kill all copies of yourself because some of the copies of you went and did other things, so on. David goes on to say, quote, On average, though, we should presumably benefit greatly from studying their future history. Although it is not our future history, and although knowing of a possible impending disaster is not the same thing as knowing what to do about it, we should presumably learn much from such a detailed record of what, from our point of view, might, happen. Our visitors might bring details of great scientific and artistic achievements. If these were made in the near future of the other universe, it is likely that counterparts of the people who made them

### 56m

would exist in our universe and might already be working towards those achievements. All at once, they would be presented with completed versions of their work. Would they be grateful? There is another apparent time travel paradox here. Since it does not appear to create inconsistencies, but mere curiosities, it has been discussed more in fiction than in scientific arguments against time travel, though some philosophers, such as Michael Dumais, have taken it seriously. I call it the knowledge paradox of time travel. Here is how the story typically goes. Okay, just pausing there, my reflection. Just notice, very importantly there, the key word apparent. We really need to linger on this, apparent. These knowledge paradoxes, are not paradoxes either. They have solutions. Well, they have one solution, which is the multiverse. The multiverse exists. So these knowledge paradoxes that David's about to go into are solved.

### 57m

They're not real paradoxes. As he says, quote, setting up the thought experiment, quote, a future historian with an interest in Shakespeare uses a time machine to visit the great playwright at a time when he is writing Hamlet. They have a conversation in the course of which the time traveller shows Shakespeare the text of Hamlet's to be or not to be soliloquy, which he has brought with him from the future. Shakespeare likes it and incorporates it into the play. In another version, Shakespeare dies and the time traveller assumes his identity, achieving success by pretending to write plays, which he is secretly copying from the complete works of Shakespeare, which he brought with him from the future. In yet another version, the time traveller is puzzled by not being able to locate Shakespeare at all. Through some chain of accidents, he finds himself impersonating Shakespeare and again plagiarising his plays. He likes the life and years later, he realises that he has become the Shakespeare.

### 58m

There never had been another one. Incidentally, the time machine in these stories would have to be provided by some extraterrestrial civilisation, which had already achieved time travel by Shakespeare's day and which was willing to allow a historian to use one of their scarce non-renewable slots for travelling back to that time. to use one of their scarce non-renewable slots for travelling back to that time. to use one of their scarce non-renewable slots for travelling back to that time. Or perhaps, even less likely, I guess, there might be a usable, naturally occurring time machine in the vicinity of some black hole. End quote. Now, I don't think that David says there incidentally. I don't think that's incidental. It's key if you have hope of going into the past. The laws of physics as we know them don't prohibit time travel. We cannot travel into the past unless the time machine already exists. We cannot travel into the past unless the time machine already exists. Okay. Taken together, we humans can still travel into the past when we think about those premises seriously,

### 59m

the two premises seriously. Namely, that the laws of physics do not prohibit travel into the past. And also, you need to have a time machine already existing at the time at which you want to travel to in the past. So, that just means you need a naturally occurring time machine or an alien civilisation, something like that, if you haven't already invented the time machine. You know, if you're going to use this quantum fluctuation idea, for example, where these tiny little wormholes might exist or something like that, well, maybe we can shrink ourselves or have the information from our minds put into a stream of something that travels fast enough and is small enough in order to get through this wormhole. And go into the past, think, you know, that movie, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. I don't know. It's an old movie, kind of the hero of the movie, Rick Moranis' character. It's a comedy. If you're a younger person, you know what I'm talking about.

### 1h 0m

Rick Moranis plays a scientist who correctly observes that most of an atom, as you're told in high school, most of an atom is empty space. And because most of an atom is empty space, why not just reduce the amount of empty space and hence the size of atoms? Well, aside from the fact that quantum theory prohibits that utterly, nevertheless, if quantum theory is false in certain respects, we could, we could transmit ourselves through a wormhole in some strange way. David goes on to say, quote, All these stories relate a perfectly consistent chain or rather circle of events. The reason why they are puzzling and deserve to be called paradoxes lies elsewhere. It is that in each story, great literature comes into existence without anyone having written it. No one originally wrote it. No one has created it.

### 1h 1m

And that proposition, though logically consistent, profoundly contradicts our understanding of where knowledge comes from. According to the epistemological principles I set out in chapter three, knowledge does not come into existence fully formed. It exists only as the result of creative processes. Which are step by step evolutionary processes, always starting with a problem and proceeding with tentative new theories, criticism and the elimination of errors to a new and preferable problem situation. This is how Shakespeare wrote his plays. It is how Einstein discovered his field equations. It is how all of us succeed in solving any problem, large or small, in our lives or in creating anything of value. End quote. And just let's reflect on that. Now, to be fair, in the beginning of infinity, David does talk about creation of knowledge ex nihilo.

### 1h 2m

But I interpret this as being almost like a placeholder of a kind for that which we do not know when it comes to knowledge creation. I think it's genuine creation because what, just as with the creation of species, what it's saying is that explanatory knowledge is not merely recombination of existing stuff, which is the prevailing view, that whatever has gone before, whatever human beings have previously discovered, yes, combine it in a slightly different way. And out of that, you're able to derive your knowledge via some method of induction or something like that. David says, no, it's actual creation. But it's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not.

### 1h 3m

But it's not. It's not. But it's not. It's not. So the idea is that our conjectures come into our minds via unknown processes, literal creation. But it can't quite be a naked singularity type of literal nothing. sometimes we can even tell the difference between sense and nonsense in other words we know the difference between knowledge and its opposites but if it was a naked singularity from which the knowledge was coming then we'd be overwhelmed with nonsense and we simply wouldn't survive just to go to the beginning of infinity for a moment in chapter four creation there's a name of the chapter there uh david writes quote this is on page 104 by the way chapter four page 104 quote what science and creative thought in general achieves is unpredictable creation ex nihilo so does biological evolution no other process does end quote later on in

### 1h 4m

chapter 13 of the beginning of infinity choices david writes quote the civilization of the environment enlightenment did not get where it is today by cleverly sharing out the wealth votes or anything else that was in dispute when it began it got here by creating ex nihilo end quote that's from page 345 now all of that is to say david does endorse this idea of creation ex nihilo but what he means by that exactly we'd have to ask him directly my interpretation this is merely my interpretation is just to say that there is a an aspect to knowledge creation which is generally creative when we say that shakespeare created hamlet as the example just used in in the fabric of reality there we don't mean that there was nothing there from which he was drawing on after all there was

### 1h 5m

a pre-existing english language but to say that the works of shakespeare are merely recombinations of existing language you know just take the english language and you recombine it in in in a different way and that's how you get the works of shakespeare that doesn't explain anything that doesn't explain a a thing about how shakespeare did what he did with his plays or his poems or anything like that it's not a mere recombination it's it's it's recombination of the works of shakespeare recombination of existing language and something more and sometimes actually invention of words he did actually invent a whole bunch of words there's some very interesting youtube videos about that that talk about how this idea that shakespeare invented more words than anyone else is true and false in ways you wouldn't expect for example it's false that he claimed many of

### 1h 6m

the words often attributed to him but it's true to say he did in fact invent many many new words k created new words but then the people who object to this idea that we actually create knowledge might very well say ah but those words that shakespeare invented are merely recombinations of existing letters that existed in the english language or existing sounds or phonemes that exist in the english language okay so those people will say anything to deny the fact that people literally create stuff let's go back to the book and david continues quote it is also how new living species come into existence the analog of a problem in this case is an ecological niche the theories are genes and the tentative new theories are mutated genes the criticism and elimination of errors are natural selection knowledge is created by intentional human action biological adaptations by a blind mindless

### 1h 7m

mechanism the words we use to describe the two processes are different and the processes are physically dissimilar too but the detailed laws of epistemology that govern them both are the same in one case they are called popper's theory of the growth of scientific knowledge in the other darwin's theory of evolution one could formulate a knowledge paradox just as well in terms of living species pausing there my reflection the language that david tends to use in the beginning of infinity is somewhat different to popper's because he's improved on popper here in the fabric of reality he's referring to the growth of scientific knowledge but it is broader than that and david talks about the growth of explanatory knowledge as opposed to biological knowledge yes popper explains explanatory knowledge all of his theory applies to explanatory knowledge whereas darwin's theory of evolution is about the knowledge contained within genes in both cases

### 1h 8m

useful information in both cases information that tends to get itself copied is what constitutes knowledge but everything else there is accurate in terms of the terminology that we still use now namely knowledge is created by what we might call an intelligently designed process or rather explanatory knowledge is created by an intelligently designed process whereas biological knowledge is generated by a blind process so david's about to go into the thought experiment about well what if you use this time machine in order to take species back to before they actually evolved or what he says here is this quote one could form a knowledge paradox just as well in terms of living species say we did take some mammals in a time machine to the age of the dinosaurs when no mammals had yet evolved we release our mammals the dinosaurs die out and our mammals take over thus new species have come into existence without having evolved

### 1h 9m

pausing there my reflection on the assumption that we have this single universe theory then we've got the paradox but of course this whole idea this whole way of phrasing things is part of the thought experiment to show you what can't be possible in reality those new species have come into existence and they did by a process of evolution of course as he says quote thus new species have come into existence without having ever evolved it is even easier to see why this version is philosophically unacceptable it implies a non darwinian evolution of species and specifically creationism admittedly no creator in the traditional sense is involved nevertheless the origin of species in this story is distinctly supernatural the story gives no explanation and rules out the possibility of there being an explanation of how the species and complex adaptations of the species to their niches got there

### 1h 10m

and quote yes again in that story but we're about to get to the solution but just before we get to that david's going to again provide us with an important sequence of sentences basically a paragraph which are key for anyone who's interested like me in understanding epistemology more deeply so let's get to that and david writes quote in this way knowledge situations violate epistemological or if you like evolutionary principles they are paradoxical only because they involve the creation out of nothing of complex human knowledge or of complex biological adaptations analogous stories with other sorts of object or information on the loop not paradoxical observe a pebble on a beach then travel back to yesterday locate the pebble elsewhere and move it to where you are going to find it

### 1h 11m

why did you find it at that particular location because you moved it there why did you move it there because you found it there you have caused some information the position of the pebble to come into existence on a self-consistent loop but so what the pebble had to be somewhere provided the story does not involve getting something for nothing by way of knowledge or adaptation it is no paradox end quote so what's the key set of sentences there it is the elucidation of the difference between useless information and knowledge knowledge is useful information information that tends to get itself copied not all information is knowledge but all knowledge is information knowledge is information with causal power in other words something that is going to change in significant ways that the multiverse in some way

### 1h 12m

and tends to grow get replicated that kind of thing and there we have hints of that notion david continues quote in the multiverse view the time traveler who visits shakespeare has not come from the future of that copy of shakespeare he can affect or perhaps replace the copy he visits but he can never visit the copy who existed in the universe that he started from and it is that copy that wrote the plays so the multiverse view is the time traveler who visits shakespeare has not come from the future of that copy of shakespeare so the plays had a genuine author and there are no paradoxical loops of the kind envisaged in the story knowledge and adaptation are even in the presence of pathways to the past brought into existence only incrementally by acts of human creativity or biological evolution and no other way end quote also a key part of these principles of epistemology

### 1h 13m

sets linger on all of that david is saying in other words if you take a copy of the complete works of shakespeare back to the time just before shakespeare was born for example choose to yourself publish them the timeline from which you came stretches back to the real shakespeare who did indeed write the place so you following this path back to the past a past where there is an identical Shakespeare and you publish the works of Shakespeare the complete works of Shakespeare before he did or in other words interrupt Shakespeare's capacity to write the plays himself isn't paradoxical because the copy of Shakespeare who actually wrote the play still exists and you can't get there you can't change the fact that he indeed wrote those plays you're traveling back into a past which is different by virtue of the

### 1h 14m

fact that you're there you're there by the way in all of this when we do these thought experiments we are ignoring the so-called problem of Shakespeare that goes around did he really write the plays did he really exist was he more than one person who cares about any of that assume he did exist and wrote them and so on the universes where they are were written exist in the multiverse full stop end of story and always will always have to some extent as well you can't erase them they're there in the multiverse they're unaffected unaffected by the fact that you travel back in time you can travel back to universes that look for all the world identical to the ones where your book can trace its history to the complete works of Shakespeare they are indeed fungible with it until so much time as you turn up but when you do turn up they immediately differentiate again upon

### 1h 15m

your arrival and that my dear listener is the solution to all this problem with knowledge stuff in time travel physics David likely says this better than me so let me read what he said again quote and then I'll I'll go on from there quote knowledge and adaptation are even in the presence of pathways to the past brought into existence only incrementally by acts of human creativity or biological evolution and in no other way he goes on I wish I could report this requirement is also rigorously implemented by the laws that quantum theory imposes on the multiverse I expect it is but this is hard to prove because it is hard to express the desired property in the current language of theoretical physics what mathematical formula distinguishes knowledge or adaptation from worthless information what physical attributes

### 1h 16m

distinguish a creative process from a non-creative one although we cannot yet answer these questions I do not think that the situation is hopeless remember the conclusions of chapter 8 about the significance of life and of knowledge in the multiverse I pointed out there for reasons quite unconnected with time travel that knowledge creation and biological evolution are physically significant processes and one of the reasons was that those processes and only those have a particular effect on parallel universes namely to create trans universe structure by making them become alike when one day we understand the details of this effect we may be able to define knowledge adaptation creativity and evolution in terms of the convergence of universes end quote okay so why is this well because knowledge is useful information as I keep on saying if it is created in one place it will be created in other places in the universe

### 1h 17m

why well because it solves the problems of people there Newton's laws we expect to be discovered in more than one place in more than at more than one time it doesn't mean that it's necessary to discover Newton's laws for example to discover Newton's laws before you can get to relativity that's not required it's not required that classical mechanics are going to be able to be there before you get to quantum mechanics for example but but in so far as knowledge is useful information it can be discovered over and over again for example in the case of Newton's laws of physics they were discovered by us they can be discovered by versions of us in other parts of the multiverse they can be discovered by aliens on the other side of our universe because hey it's knowledge it's solving problems it's going to be rediscovered over and again not necessarily but like lots of different kinds of scientific knowledge one would presume that if it is created

### 1h 18m

in one place it'll be created in another place now how does this creation work why should it converge why should why should people in different parts of the multiverse find the same knowledge well that is yet to be fully discovered all we can say is me waving my hands here say things like the universe has become similar structure grows throughout the multiverse and so therefore knowledge itself can be seen as we have said in our discussions on the beginning of infinity it grows like a crystal across the multiverse many universes will discover the same knowledge over time because the same problems are being encountered and so sometimes the same solutions will be hit upon across the multiverse but again there's nothing preventing our ancestors in other universes the equivalent of our ancestors in other universes people in the year 1000 ad let's say 1000 common era as it's often called

### 1h 19m

nothing prevents them those people from finding out quantum mechanics without ever passing through newton's laws of physics for example or aristotle's physics or any other misconception after all those things are errors but they would still have to find quantum theory via an incremental process but it might just be a different incremental process in any case many places across the multiverse will have newton's laws instantiated quantum theory instantiated the laws of chemistry instantiated and so on scientific knowledge is like this david goes on to say quote when i enact a paradox there are eventually two copies of me in one universe and none in the other it is a general rule that after time travel has taken place the total number of copies of me counted across all universes is unchanged similarly the usual conservation laws for mass

### 1h 20m

energy and other physical quantities continue to hold for the multiverse as a whole though not necessarily in any one universe however there is no conservation law for knowledge possession of a time machine would allow us to access knowledge from an entirely new source namely the creativity of minds and other universes they could also receive knowledge from us so one can loosely speak of a trade in knowledge and the other is that we can access knowledge from another universe and indeed a trade in artifacts embodying knowledge across many universes pausing there and let's just consider what we're talking about here the total number of copies of me or you or whatever the person or whatever the object remains unchanged across the multiverse why is that because and the number of universes is the same at all times at all times ever since the big bang the number of universes has been the same however they differentiate and you differentiate moment to moment you work let's pick an arbitrary point the moment at which you were born the number of

### 1h 21m

instances of you is the same they're just all the same to begin with and then you start making subtly different choices and so they differentiate over time and you have this measure this measure of different instances of you and that's how we talk about the infinity of the copies of you and we won't run out of copies of you no matter how many different things you do okay so that's one issue that idea of conservation but there's no conservation of knowledge we can use time machines for example to bring knowledge to a region of the multiverse that otherwise would not have had it as david is going to talk to right now so let's just go there he says quote the multiverse will never be a free trade area because the laws of quantum mechanics impose drastic restrictions on which snapshots can be connected to which others for one thing two universes first become connected only at a moment when they are identical becoming connected makes them

### 1h 22m

begin to diverge it is only when those differences have accumulated and new knowledge has been created in one universe and sent back in time to the other that we could receive knowledge that does not already exist in our universe a more accurate way of thinking about the inter-universe trade in knowledge is to think of all of our knowledge generating processes our whole culture and civilization and all the thought processes in the minds of every individual and indeed the entire evolving biosphere as well as being a gigantic computation the whole thing is executing a self-motivated self-generating computer program and quote just be careful now though this is another section worth reflecting on and repeating he is not saying David is not saying that all of the multiverse or even any single universe is a giant computation

### 1h 23m

he's not endorsing the simulation hypothesis just the knowledge generating processes in terms of perhaps the whole biosphere where all the people are and perhaps where all the living things are being created so again not endorsing the simulation hypothesis which is the theory that the entire the entirety of physical reality is something it's not a theory it's not a computation it's not saying that that hypothesis the simulation hypothesis raises more questions than it ever answers okay it's like God saying God did it all okay the simulation hypothesis has just the same set of problems you would ask of the simulation hypothesis what computer is it running on what is the hardware made of what laws of physics does the hardware obey on which this simulation is running who is running the simulation is that hypothesis is it running on the whole computer obeying different laws of physics running on hardware that we don't know about

### 1h 24m

itself being simulated and yet a higher order computer simulation of some sort and so it goes and then you get into this Bostrom's idea that it's just simulation running on simulations but it doesn't solve the base problem of what reality really consists of it just pushes the problem further out it's like if God created the universe it's like well where is God what laws does God obey if you're interested in fundamental explanations God did it doesn't solve that nor does the simulation hypothesis it doesn't help at all it's just pushing the problem back a step further in fact into a region which by the definition of the thought experiment whether it's God or the simulation hypothesis that you do not have experimental access to okay you're trapped inside of the simulation or trapped inside of God's creation yeah they're equivalent okay one just uses fancy technological speak and so people think it sounds more scientific it's no more scientific than God did it

### 1h 25m

the simulator did it who cares okay it's it's it's all an avoidance of the interesting stuff what is reality like how can we come to create explanations about it how can we use our understanding to generate technology how can we gain control of physical reality that's what we're interested in not what is this ultimate explanation in terms of God or simulation or whether or not we're dreaming at all who cares about any of that boring let's go back and just repeat that David has said you can think of all our knowledge generating processes our whole culture and civilization and all the thought processes in the minds of every individual and indeed the entire evolving biosphere as well as being a gigantic computation the whole thing is executing a self-motivated self-generating computer program more specifically it is as I have mentioned a virtual reality program in the process of rendering with

### 1h 26m

ever-increasing accuracy the whole of existence in other universes there are other versions of this virtual reality generator some identical some very different okay just repeating again that little section there all of our civilization all of our thought generating processes all the people that that are alive are generating a self-generating process of self-generating virtual reality rendering their understanding of physical reality so our understanding all of our knowledge is coming to resemble what physical reality is truly like with ever-increasing accuracy as we solve our problems as we generate explanatory theories of the rest of physical reality okay one is coming to resemble the other the knowledge is coming to resemble the reality with increasing react your accuracy over time as he says quote in other universes there are other versions of this virtual reality generator some identical some very

### 1h 27m

different if such a virtual reality generator had access to a time machine it would be able to receive some of the results of computations performed by its counterparts in other universes insofar as the laws of physics allowed the requisite interchange of information each piece of knowledge that one obtains from a time machine will have had an author somewhere in the multiverse but it may benefit untold numbers of different universes so a time machine is a computational resource that allows us to understand the universe and the universe as a whole so a time machine is a computational resource that allows us to understand the universe as a whole so a time machine is a computational resource that allows us to understand the universe and the universe as a whole so a time machine is a certain types of computation to be formed with enormously greater efficiency than they could be on any individual computer it achieves its efficiency by effectively sharing computational work among copies of itself in different universes excellent pausing there just my reflection on that all right we're back after the loss of camera happily the audio was preserved there though we've just said a time machine is a computational resource that can be used to perform the work of a computer it can be used to regular computations with enormously greater efficiency than they could be on any individual

computer. In other words, what David means by this is if you travel into the past to share information with those in the past who don't have it yet, for example, like how to cure a particular disease and presumably live longer and therefore go on to discover things not known by people in the time you came from. So their future ends up being better and getting better faster than what your future did. And that process can be repeated presumably an indefinite number of times or almost an indefinite number of times, or at least effectively an indefinite number of times. David goes on to say, quote, in the absence of time machines, there tends to be very little interchange of information between universes because the laws of physics predict, in that case, very little causal contact between them. To a good degree of approximation, knowledge created in one

### 1h 29m

set of identical snapshots reaches relatively few other snapshots, namely those that are stacked onto space times to the future of the original snapshots. But this is only an approximation. Interference phenomena are the result of causal contact between nearby universes. We've seen in chapter nine that even this minuscule level of contact can be used to exchange significant computationally useful information. between universes. The study of time travel provides an arena, albeit at present only a theoretical thought experiment arena, in which we can see writ large some of the connections between what I call the four main strands. All four strands play essential roles in the explanation of time travel, end quote. This is because you need biology, you need an understanding of evolution by natural selection. Biology, I think, is a very important part of the explanation of time travel. After all, leads to people, and people create explanatory knowledge that can be used to construct and understand

### 1h 30m

time machines. Understanding is a kind of computation. Time machines and the computers, which presumably help run or control them, however computers will be involved then, they, both computers and time machines, are permitted by the laws of physics. So we have their evolution, computation, knowledge, and physics, or, if you like, biology, computer science, epistemology, and quantum physics. Although, really, there's just the study of knowledge, including biological knowledge, biological and explanatory knowledge, and the study of quantum computation. So we're down to two strands, really, because computation and physics has already been united, and epistemology and evolution by natural selection has been united, by David, by the way. So the four strands reduce to two strands, and ultimately we should expect, and I would certainly expect,

### 1h 31m

it's all one strand, it's all one reality, everything will be subsumed because of the totalitarian nature of the subject by physics. So there will be a physics of epistemology, a physics of knowledge, a quantum physics of knowledge, or a future physics of knowledge, presumably. So that's the strands, and that's the way the four strands can be used to explain, time machines, and also how the four strands can come together to explain, or at least give us a window on, the nature of personhood and people. And that's why I did this Nexus video. I'm often referring to the Nexus video, and the reason is because the four strands are critically important if you want to have a good understanding of personhood. I may as well read the final paragraph here in this chapter. David goes on to say, quote, Time travel may be achieved one day, or it may not. But if it is, it should not require any fundamental change in world view,

### 1h 32m

at least for those who broadly share the world view I am presenting in this book. All the connections that it could set up between past and future are comprehensible and non-paradoxical, and all the connections that it would necessitate between apparently unconnected fields of knowledge are there anyway. End quote. And there ends David's discussion of time travel, and hence my expectation. position of this particular chapter as well a wonderful way for us to lead into the second last chapter of the book of the fabric of reality because the second last chapter chapter 13 is titled the four strands and so this is a natural way in which to lead into a discussion of the significance of the four strands two chapters left to go in the discussion of the fabric of i hope you've enjoyed learning about time travel as i have in explaining it until next time bye
