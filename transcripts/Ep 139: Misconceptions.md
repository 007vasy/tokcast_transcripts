Misconceptions. Fallibilism is the stance that we can always be objectively wrong. This means there is something to be objectively wrong about. So it implies realism, while at the same time rejecting relativism. The idea there is no way of being objectively wrong, and also dogmatism, the idea that sometimes, about some things at least, one cannot possibly be wrong because one has found the final truth. This idea that it is possible to get to the final truth, that the truth is manifest, as Karl Popper said, only ever leads to tyranny. That may seem like a bold claim, and it may be, but that does not make it any less true. And yes, I said true there, because there is nothing about this stance that rejects truth. The opposite. It is just that we can never know we have found the truth. But our best explanations must contain truth, for if they are good explanations, then, objectively, they solve a problem.

They work. But they can only work by saying something correct. Something correct about the world. Something true. But they will always also contain misconceptions. We are fallible, and no single theory can possibly describe everything. In other words, every theory, every explanation, is a misconception. David Deutsch once said that it would have been better for the broader understanding of the process of science had we all, long ago, agreed not to call theories, theories, but rather, misconceptions. So we would have the scientific misconception of gravity, and the scientific misconception of evolution by natural selection, or of climate change, particle physics, or tectonic plates. And what happens is that we, over time, replace one deep, explanatory misconception with another, by correcting some errors, by finding just a little more truth. Truth we cannot quantify, and truth we cannot speak exactly, but truth nonetheless. And those errors are corrected.

In truth, those are genuine problems solved with the new explanation. The new, better, misconception. Popper wrote, quote, There is only one way to science, or to philosophy, for that matter. To meet a problem, to see its beauty and fall in love with it, to get married to it, and to live with it happily till death do ye part, unless you should meet another and even more fascinating problem, or unless, indeed, you should obtain a solution. But even if you do, obtain a solution, you may then discover, to your delight, the existence of a whole family of enchanting, though perhaps difficult, problem children, for whose welfare you may work with a purpose to the end of your days, end quote. He may have understated things there, for if you do find a solution, you will indeed discover more problems. They will be revealed to you. For, in standing on the shoulders of giants, you can see further. More problems, more errors, more misconceptions. But those are more interesting. Those are better problems. They are more interesting to have. A vaccine is a solution, but it's never perfect.

But it is far better than vast numbers of people simply being infected with whatever the disease is. So too for any medical intervention. This is why we have the term side effects. New, better problems. So, your hair fell out and you felt quite tired and ill, but you did not die from the cancer. Einstein's theory of general relativity solved problems Newtonian gravity could not, like anomalies with Mercury's orbit. But in doing so, it opened up a vision of reality that was more grand and filled with new problems not conceivable before. Space and time as a fabric that could warp and bend, forming effects like gravitational lensing. It opened up the problem of how to build a global positioning system of super high precision, now coded into all mobile phones with Google Maps for location finding. It revealed the possibility of gravitational waves and therefore the problem of how to detect them. But should we expect general relativity to contain no misconceptions? Quite the opposite. It too must be a misconception.

### 4m

But how? We do not know, only that it must be because it cannot be the final word. Nothing can. As well as general relativity works, it cannot be the final story because it conflicts with quantum theory. Both purport to be universal claims about physical reality, but they cannot be the final complete word. There must be some successor to both, despite they're both making astonishingly precise predictions, despite their solving of problems. They can't be the final word. There must be successors to them both, or a single successor. And to that, another. For we will never have a theory that explains everything. From the motion of fundamental particles and the behaviour of space and time, through to how life evolves, and why historical events happen, and how human beings make the choices they do, and why J.R.R. Tolkien didn't write more books. So because no single theory can explain everything, there is always something it will be missing. Always some misconception it has about how to explain the world.

### 5m

And we are fallible anyway, we who create the explanations. We cannot guarantee anything we find is error-free, anything we create is error-free. All is a woven web of guesses. All is a great tapestry of misconception coming to represent reality a little better over time, but never capturing it all, just correcting errors here and there. And there are infinite errors. They are everywhere. And always will be. But we make progress nonetheless, by correcting them, and moving from misconception to ever better misconception.
