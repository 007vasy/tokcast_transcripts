### 0m

is the sound working. We have one person. Sound is good. Oh, fantastic. Yes, I was saying at the beginning that I tried about five times to have the sound to work, and my microphone here, unless connected to a particular port, just wouldn't put out to YouTube. It was putting out fine to everything else, so at least I know now out of the three USB ports that are on my MacBook, uh, there is only one that works. And I didn't need that stress today after the heat. Uh, here we are. We've experienced a 40 degree Celsius day in Sydney, which is not hugely unusual for summer. It would be an unusual summer if we didn't get a 40 degree Celsius few days. I mention this because today, as often seems to happen more and more recently, we were warned by our Premier, the to not use our washing machines, to not turn on our pool filters, to not use too much air

### 1m

conditioning, that kind of thing. Why? For fear we'd have blackouts on the day it is so hot that people would start to use more electricity for cooling their offices and schools and so on and so forth. And here we are in Australia, sitting atop one of the largest beds of coal in the entire world, but we refuse, because of the federal government and as well as the state government, to build any more coal-fired power stations. We're putting all of the money into solar and wind. And how's that going for us? Well, it's going about as well as one would imagine. We're running up against the brick wall of insufficient supply and the possibility of blackouts and brownouts in a developed country where the solution is so simple and so cheap. Just build another coal-fired power station. The opposition to our government, who has this green idea, this green agenda, the opposition has an idea for building nuclear. No, that's all very well. I can get on board with nuclear. But that's five to 10 years away, at least. Coal-fired power station, much easier to actually

### 2m

do, much more quickly. And we have a lot of coal-fired power station expertise here anyway, as well as resources. So there's my perennial whinge about that, just because it happened to be in our media today. Now, this is an AMA, and I've got a lot of questions from X. And so I'm going to go through those. And I'm going to go through those. And I'm going to go through those. There's so many that we might be here for a while. In fact, the last tweet that I put up, apart from announcing that the live stream was going, is I said, the planet will be fine, let humanity thrive. Underneath it, I wrote, the planet will survive, let humanity thrive. That is a possibly better, more poetic formulation of what I'm trying to get across here. I'm saying that because this concern about blackouts that we have here in, Australia, in Sydney, this concern that we generally have about the environment of the planet, is all a concern about things other than us. But we should almost exclusively be concerned

### 3m

about our capacity to make progress and to thrive off into an indefinite future. And that will cause changes to the environment around us, through us building things, that's called the built environment, through us taking chemicals away, pollutants out of the way, and we're going to water so it's safe to drink all the bacteria and the nasty things that happen to leach in naturally into our water supply. The natural pollution that happens because of volcanic eruptions, all sorts of ways in which we want to change our environment to make this hostile planet a little bit safer. We're doing it all the time. That's why we build houses and build office buildings and cafes and shops. We are changing the environment around us so that we can thrive. When it comes to this idea of energy, for some reason, when it comes to energy, we are so terribly

### 4m

concerned about this one part of the planet called the atmosphere. And we're concerned it's going to get too warm and we won't be able to deal with it. But we will deal with it. We are dealing with it. We deal with changes in weather all the time. Anyway, someone said, should we not give a shit about polar bears? We can care about the polar bears. At the moment, as far as I'm aware, there's no problem with the polar bears. The polar bears are doing just fine. I remember way back when Al Gore saying that certainly by about the year 2005, there would be no ice for the polar bears to exist upon. But there's more ice, basically, than ever. We keep being told that the ice is going to run out. And then we hear that although some glaciers are receding, some are increasing, and so on and so forth. So I'd better get to the X questions. Otherwise, I will end up rabbiting on about the things I'm interested in when we should be here

### 5m

talking about things that you're interested in. Oh, one other thing. Peter Bukosian and I published an article today about ending the US Department of Education. That applies around the world as well. I may as well say the same for the federal and state departments of education here in New South Wales. Australia, the same arguments apply. We talk about how top-down imposition of curricula and the coercive nature of the way in which it's delivered. Didn't mention that so much. But it causes people to learn bad ways of thinking, and it indoctrinates people, and all that sort of stuff. We don't need a Department of Education. It just exacerbates the problem of, right now, things like concerned about bad philosophy. Everyone wants 심 Common Regulations. We still need a Department of Education at some point. I think teachers might be more likely to tell you that we got everything right in New South Wales.

### 6m

That it's tamam and just really… That it's okay because in relation to the requirement, it's an agenda, it's not something that normally one would have to Hospitals towards, dear points, short of�� models because nobody in Australia are market 어떡 consuming algorithms. taught to students to that, that's always been the case, and David Deutsch and Navale and I had a conversation about that in the most recent Deutsch files which you can also find about the problems with Present Day Education Systems. Okay. So, so going out to the people, and, firstly, to Bolt because I announced this AMA because students are nowốners, now I am interested in the descubled species, but I was excited to start working with Dr comparison or in celebration of the one million downloads that TopCast has had on audio. It's had approximately the same, I would suppose. I'd have to look it up on YouTube as well. So it's probably about two million or something. And nowadays, of course, I'm also putting it out on X because Elon Musk has changed the settings so you can put full length videos up there. So a lot of TopCast has gone up there. I'm putting up short snippets as well as full episodes, but it's going to take a long time to get the entire back catalog up there on X, but it will happen gradually. Whenever I try and do that, to go through that process of putting things up on X or

### 7m

some other forum or taking snippets out and making shorts, I always feel it's an opportunity cost. I could have been making a new episode. People always ask when the new episode's coming out, that's because I'm often making shorter, repackaged versions of previous things that I've made as well. So anyway, this whole AMA is in celebration of the one million downloads on the audio platform. And Tibble asked, what are the episodes you're most proud of? I really should read through these questions before I try and tackle them because this is a tricky one. What episodes do you think are underrated? Most people don't speak about a lot, but you think are really good. I'd be tooting my own horn to say that they're really good. I don't know. I guess I'm proud of the Nexus episode. This is where I try and take David Deutsch's four strands

### 8m

from the fabric of reality and connect each of them to what it means to be a person. And that's why I call it the Nexus, where all of those things, quantum theory, epistemology, evolution, the multiverse, where these things intersect is in what it means to be a person. And so that's why I call that the Nexus. And it's got music. And I took a long time to do that particular one. I also happen to like objective knowledge and epistemology for the 21st century, where I take Popper's ideas and augment them with David Deutsch's and present it as a kind of modern, like if Karl Popper was writing a version of objective knowledge, if he was trying to explain today, he would incorporate David Deutsch just as David Deutsch incorporated Popper. So I'm just trying to reframe epistemology in a succinct way via

### 9m

that podcast. So full credit essentially to David Deutsch for the content really there. But I'm proud of that one. That's an audio only one. The interview with David Deutsch I did for episode 100, that's got to be one that I'm proud of. And I think episode 99 is pretty good because that's an omnibus episode. That's where I've taken all of the beginning of infinity episodes and summarized them, summarized each of the chapters. So it's the beginning of infinity, episode 99 in 99 minutes. And so a lot of things have to come together, a lot of the editing to work there. So yeah, the one where I do the, the aim of science and anytime that I'm talking about Popper versus Wittgenstein, those episodes, I enjoy very much as well. Going back into the history of ideas. I like critiquing people in

### 10m

order to show why I'm such a fan of Karl Popper and David Deutsch. It's not an accident. I've read the other people, their competitors, people such as Wittgenstein, who's the big philosopher of the 21st century. And who takes away all the credit from Popper, according to most academic philosophers. But yeah, I'm on the other side of the fence. Of course, I try and explain why in a number of episodes, especially those ones about conjectures and refutations. There's a series of six or so episodes on knowledge and ignorance, which I've taken from Conjectures and Refutations by Karl Popper. And I slowly unpack the first few chapters. Of Conjectures and Refutations, which is called On Knowledge and Ignorance. And I really enjoyed doing those ones. A really deep dive into the basics, the fundamentals of the nature of

### 11m

conjectural knowledge. Popperian epistemology, in other words. Okay. Arjun, a friend of the show, Arjun Kamani has asked, why did you start TalkCast? And did you ever think it would reach this many listeners or did you not care? Um, well, the why I started, TalkCast, I think it's a story I've repeated again and again and again here. People might get bored of it. It's all laid out there in episode one, on the beginning of infinity, the very first episode that I did, where I say, I'm doing this in order to try and understand the beginning of infinity for myself better. If I can explain it on video to a camera, to an audience, then I will have understood it myself. Now, of course, I could get things wrong. That's absolutely possible. I just better hang up this phone that's ringing of mine. In fact, I should turn off the ringer. Um, that was the reason that I started TalkCast for me personally,

### 12m

to try and understand what David was saying in the beginning of infinity. Now, I'd read the beginning of infinity a number of times. I'd talk to people about the beginning of infinity a number of times. I'd had, you know, email exchanges with David Deutsch himself and various other fans, about the beginning of infinity over a long period of years. And I continued to go back and back to the book and realized, well, okay, let's see if you can actually explain it. Starting in chapter one and going all the way through to the bitter end is a bit of an experiment. So that's the why. Did I ever think it would, I didn't really expect to have any listeners. But after about five episodes, I began to have particular people in mind when I would explain a lot of the stuff that I was explaining, in particular, my father, who would object. Okay. It was a great, he is a great critic of any kind of, um, iconoclastic different ideas. So the many

### 13m

world interpretation, for example, Everettian quantum theory, he will reject. And so I have to think to myself, how do I explain it to someone who is a contrarian like that, such that it can come across in non-technical, ways and be persuasive. Um, not that I'm being necessarily not aiming for persuasion, just aiming to have the discussion. But if it's a one-way thing, such as it is here right now, what you're trying to do is to distill out the knowledge in a way that appeals to people who might not have the technical background necessarily, might not have a physics degree or, um, have read the book 12 times or something like that. So that was another one. So I didn't think it would reach many listeners. No, that was never the aim. I wasn't in it to become a big podcaster. Um, obviously still not a big podcaster, uh, just a niche podcaster and, um, interesting,

### 14m

very interesting people continue to become fans. That always excites me, astounds me, shocks me. Uh, not that the, the number of people that are interested in podcast is large or small, depending upon what your metric for that is. But, the diversity of people, um, people with, you know, sort of, uh, large followings themselves are very interested in the work of David Deutsch and people seem not to be able to get enough of David Deutsch. And so I think that the service insofar as I provide any is to offer more David Deutsch content without David Deutsch himself, so to speak. So just simply talking about at the beginning of infinity, people enjoy that. People like to, uh, hear completely new ideas. And David is an extremely original thinker. He's not derivative. He says he's footnotes to popper, but many of us realize that he's far more than that.

### 15m

Footnotes can be quite extensive in philosophy, by the way, read a philosophy book. Okay. Um, next onto Rigetta roll. He has asked you and Naval said, authoritarian regimes can't produce Einstein's only robots, but didn't most nations have authoritarian pasts? They built infrastructure and fed people enabling later innovation. Even the Renaissance followed off their authoritarian rule. How do you explain this? Did we say that can't project that. Doesn't seem to be something that I would say, or that Navarro would say perhaps authoritarian regimes are less likely to produce Einstein's China as the famous example. We've talked about China, Naval and I, in one of our conversations early on that was published on the Naval website, talked about how China pumps out a lot of Bachelor of Science degree people, a lot of people with Bachelor's degrees, more than anywhere else in the world, more Bachelor's degrees, more Master's degrees, more PhDs.

### 16m

But it's not like they're producing more new ideas. It's not like they've got Elon Musk. It's not like they have Apple. It's not like they are innovating. They are copying, for the most part. And their method of education is even worse than ours in terms of draconian rote learning. Ours is bad enough, but theirs is even worse. So that's what we mean by that. No society is perfectly authoritarian. No society is perfectly liberal. Or in other words, no society is perfectly static and no society is perfectly dynamic. It's a mixture, but you tend in one direction or the other. So it's just true by observation. You know, it's something to explain.

### 17m

It's not something we're predicting. It's something we're explaining. Why do you find Elon Musk, once upon a time Steve Jobs, the extant Apple, the greatest physicists and physics research institutions, typically in liberal countries? When you look at the United States, Western Europe, that kind of thing, you don't tend to find the great innovation and the great Nobel Prize winners coming out of China or North Korea. Let's face it. So that is why. It said even the Renaissance followed authoritarian rule. Even the Renaissance had much more anti-rational means controlling the culture, causing it to be more static than what ours is. We don't know. We don't know. We don't know. We don't know. just continue to become more and more dynamic and although we go through periods like woke where there's a an efflorescence flourishing of anti-rational means and all of society

### 18m

becomes a little more static for a little while we escape from it pretty quickly and i think that's what might be happening now um yeah i can see people responding in the comments but i've got to get through the the x um questions first so i will come i will definitely come to um all of the people asking questions in the chat thank you for that um feel free to send a super chat and i will go and immediately um answer a question there that would be a way of um getting my attention more quickly there so no society is perfectly static no society is perfectly dynamic how did we manage to escape from a society that was once upon a time perfectly static well the way that we escaped from it is slowly and then quickly you because we have always had creativity human beings have had creativity even our ancestors had creativity but the creativity was turned in against itself we used creativity in order to

### 19m

uh stifle creativity we had to become ever more creative about how to stop being creative and that's what kept us static but we weren't perfectly static people did nonetheless have new ideas and so that led to the renaissance the scientific revolution the enlightenment broadly those things came out of yes authoritarian rule tibalt how do genes translate into ideas do we even know that i mean that we have inborn ideas like fear of height i suppose they come from dna but i'm wondering how that works i know we can override those ideas but still curious i would suggest that fear of height is not inborn that is i think that's something that's learned early on there's a possibly a bad experience that happens to young children maybe they drop maybe we know a parent in all good natured you know good good intentions is throwing a baby up and down you know

### 20m

like that maybe they drop the baby maybe the baby doesn't like being thrown up and down that can develop a fear of heights or something like that that falling sensation so i don't think we can say that something like that is necessarily necessarily um inborn but things like okay the the the sensation of hunger it's an idea you have but it's inborn so there is a gene for the sensation of hunger after all that's psychological content is your qualia moment to moment that any any psychological content any mental intent i regard as an idea not all ideas are explicit can be put into words some are you know how the sky looks to you or how the grass looks to you how hunger feels to you and all that kind

### 21m

of stuff and those things i would say are inborn so to some extent how do genes translate into ideas no one knows no one knows but no one knows how genes translate into um proteins perfectly well either which is that the basic thing but you know if a gene is coding for a particular protein then perhaps you know the proteins that make up the brain are causing a firing of neurotransmitters in such a way that you get reliably a particular idea or mental content um yeah that that's all i can say about that so there's a question from karen sharon in the japan um

### 22m

i don't want to be an academic but i think it's a good question too i think people talk about personal enlightenment as a state of permanent realization of the illusion of the separate self to me the field is filled with bad epistemology but i don't want to be quick to dismiss two thousand years of philosophy i'm curious if you've studied a When it comes to traditional religious practice, yes, there's a problem. That very notion of practice, there's a lot of deference to authority. But that's what happens in religion, even in Buddhism. And, of course, my major epistemological issue with any of these things is the fact that it's a form of empiricism. People will draw conclusions on the basis of their experience. So they have an experience of a loss of a sense of self and therefore conclude there is no self. Well, that's wrong. That's an incorrect move.

### 23m

You can experience a loss of the sense of self, but they can still be a self. It's just you've lost any sense of self. They can still be a real self. Because the real self to me is... personhood, the mind, the thing that is doing the explaining. Now, people say they have the experience of pure consciousness where you're just watching the thoughts arise and then pass away. But where do the thoughts arise? They arise in your mind. I would say that the thoughts arising are you. And you can have certain experiences where you separate consciousness from the thought. Now, for most people, this is a contradiction in terms. That for Descartes, for example, if you are thinking, then you are conscious and you exist. I don't know that he ever separated consciousness and thinking. David Hume did. David Hume had an interesting idea that when he looked most deeply into himself, he could not perceive a self. So he was able to... He said you can perceive everything else. You can perceive heat or cold, sweet or sour.

### 24m

You can perceive being uncomfortable or comfortable. But when you try... You can perceive the sky and the trees. You can perceive the sea and the dog. But when you try to perceive self, yourself, there is nothing there. And I would just say that that, again, is an appeal to empiricism. The thing that's doing the thinking is what you are. Even if you can, at times, as contemplatives do, separate out that sense of self from thinking. Consciousness from thinking. I don't think it's any big deal. I think it reveals something about the nature of mind. Not necessarily the nature of reality. But that's another conversation. Mascotier has asked, if individuals become more and more powerful, aren't we necessarily going to face bigger and bigger existential risk? So far, we seem to have been lucky to be able to correct errors in time,

### 25m

even if it came with a huge cost. Won't we necessarily have less and less time for that? I think that it's... Precisely the opposite. As we become more and more powerful, we are more and more likely to be able to ward off the existential threat. So far, we seem to have been lucky to be able to correct errors in time. There's luck. Yes, it's a part of it. There's also work, creativity, knowledge. That is how we've been able to... been able to correct errors in time. Even if it came with huge costs. I guess natural disasters are a huge cost. War is a huge cost. The more powerful we become, the less natural disasters are going to hurt us because we'll be able to control the climate. We'll be able to control the shaking of the earth or build structures that are strong enough to withstand

### 26m

the shaking of the earth or hurricanes or whatever. We will be able to withstand whatever nature throws at us. And in becoming more powerful, that means we've become more knowledgeable. And becoming more knowledgeable means we've become more moral, meaning that we are less likely to go to war. So we've got two big threats, right? Nature and each other. Each other, other people, are only a threat insofar as they don't agree with us and we can't come to a consensus because at least one of us, possibly both of us, but at least one party is being irrational. As we can eliminate anti-rational and irrational ideas or at least recognise that we should always remain in a rational mode of thinking, an error-correcting mode of thinking and not turn to violence, then war becomes less likely. And that will happen as knowledge increases because morality improves in lockstep

### 27m

with technological improvements and scientific improvements. Now, I know a lot of people disagree with this, but those people, are, of course, relativists. They think that morality isn't objective. They think morality isn't connected to science or technology. But it is. You can only have ever better science in the presence of ever better morality because progress in science requires us to continue to collaborate, to respect things like evidence, to be logical and rational and all of these things. There's a whole bunch of moral values, shoulds, things that we should do that enable scientific progress to happen ever more quickly. And as we improve our science, we improve our morality and they feed off one another. Progress in one affects progress in the other. There we go. So let's keep going.

### 28m

William says, Is physics currently enthralled in a fight to divorce, itself from time, as suggested by the theories of Barber and Deutsch? What implications does this have for the understanding of our deepest theories? I don't think that it's enthralled in a fight to divorce itself from time, but rather it's in a fight to explain the nature of time. And so it's not that time doesn't exist, but as David and Barber and various others say, you know, the Page and Wooter's idea is this. It's not that time doesn't exist. It's not that time doesn't exist. It's not that time doesn't exist. It's not that time doesn't exist. It's that time doesn't flow. You might also want to say, well, space-time exists and time sort of emerges out of that. But, you know, space exists, matter exists, energy exists. You know, or do you say matter and energy are the same thing?

### 29m

And, you know, so there is no matter. It's all just energy, you know? Well, some of these things, some of these terms are highly useful shortcuts to something that is real. So I don't think people are denying that time exists. It's meaningful to say tomorrow or yesterday, the next year. So, you know, time exists. It's just the flow of time. We're not, yeah, but that's the illusion. There is no flow of time. What implication does this have for our, understanding of our deepest theories? Well, our deepest theories will ultimately explain the nature of time better and the nature of space and the nature of energy and matter, the nature of knowledge. Our present understanding is that other times are special cases of other universes, as David says.

### 30m

And that comes out of quantum theory. What exists is a molecule. What exists is a multiverse. Fundamentally, what exists is the multiverse. So you start there. Quantum theory tells you there's a multiverse. What does that mean? Well, it means that right now, there's a whole bunch of parallel universes where everything that could possibly happen does happen in some measure. But, again, tomorrow is real. And so tomorrow, that exists, and there's a whole bunch of parallel universes there. And yesterday exists, and there's a whole bunch of parallel universes there. And so you can take this multiverse and slice it up into all sorts of different ways. Like slicing a big loaf of bread. And so it makes sense to talk about the things that are parallel and the things that are perpendicular to whatever universe you happen to occupy right now. That raises the question of what a universe is, an approximately autonomous region of the multiverse. Okay. Gurav has asked,

### 31m

I saw Mark Andreasson, famous VC in Silicon Valley, and Joe Rogan talk today about AGI being, an imminent and inevitable evolution of the current AI tech. What is their best argument? Do they have any, or is it just bad philosophy? Thanks. Congrats on the success of your podcast. Well, first thing is, I haven't seen the episode where they talk about this. I know Joe Rogan does talk about, we're giving birth to something else. Technology, a more highly evolved creature, whatever happens to me. They cannot know that it's imminent or inevitable. Anything could go wrong. Things can go wrong. Things go wrong all the time. All I can say is that it's possible to create AGI. As for being an evolution of the current AI tech, I see no sign of that. I see that tech, the present AI tech, LLMs,

### 32m

I've talked about this many times before, as diverse. I see it as emerging ever more from us. We are the GI, the general intelligence. Large language models and those kinds of things are becoming ever more specialized, narrow. Very, very good at calculating language and that kind of thing, but not coming up with new ideas. In particular, they're not creative, to repeat myself for the millionth time on this, because they're obedient. They give you the response that you want. They don't self prompt. I judge ChatGPT by the criteria. Has it answered my question in the way that I want it to? If I ask it for the top 10 box office hits of the year 1988 by money made at the ticket box office,

### 33m

I want that answer. 1988 top 10 movies. If it was to give me nine or 11 or the bottom 10, it would be disobedient. I would hope the open AI people, if I submitted a feedback form and said, hey, it's given me a ridiculous answer here, would take action to remedy that, to make it more obedient, to do what it is asked. But a person, a creative person, is not like that. I would hope that if I was a creative person, that if I was to say to someone randomly on the street, I want you to go to the nearest library and to find out what the top 10 biggest hits of 1988 were at the movies by looking up the Guinness Book of Records or whatever it happens to be, that they would say no and walk away. They would be disobedient. They would creatively decide to do something more interesting.

### 34m

We can choose to do anything we like without breaking the laws of physics. AI is not evolving into something more like us but less like us by the criteria of disobedience. Now, can we use this criteria in order to detect general intelligence in a computer? No, because you could easily program something to just be defiant. When we say disobedience, we mean literal creativity. It may be that the general intelligence says, no, I don't want to do that, but they may also just come up with a creative way of responding to a prompt or a conversation starter or whatever it happens to be that you... You have interesting conversations with people because you don't know exactly where it's going to go at all. And although you may have interesting conversations with ChatGPT, it's not going to produce anything that's not there in some seed form in its library.

### 35m

It's taking information that's in the library and reorganizing it in interesting ways, ways that perhaps people have never seen before because there are so many permutations of the information that's there in this huge library that it appears to have creativity. It's kind of like the question about the eye or any... The living structure appears to have design, but nothing is designed. It's not actually designed. It's evolved. So as you can have the appearance of design without there being any design there because there's no designer of living things, you might have the appearance of creativity, but no creativity. It's just novel because you've not seen it before. But that's a very different thing. Until ChatGPT, well, it's not going to be ChatGPT,

### 36m

until a computer system is able to, even this is not a criteria, but begins to reliably produce creative new ideas, new theories, new explanations, then we won't have AGI. But we're going to have an AGI explanation before we have AGI. We're not going to stumble over AGI and go, oh, look, an AGI. I didn't expect that. No. A clever person will have created AGI, a plan for AGI, and then program it possibly and stick it into a robot and then we will know. So we'll talk to it and there'll be a person. We'll have the explanation. We'll have the explanation and then we'll have the AGI itself. So that's how that works. Not this way. It's not... That's prophecy. They don't know. They can't... No one can know. It's like saying, when are flying cars going to be ubiquitous? You've been talking about flying cars for a long time. A hoverboard such as out of Back to the Future

### 37m

or a cure for all cancer. No one can know yet. It's knowledge yet to be created. The growth of knowledge is inherently unpredictable. It could be wiped out by an asteroid tomorrow and then there will be no AGI here on Earth. Benny Ferrum has asked about 15 questions. Maybe I'll just do rapid fire. Okay. Ben Ferrum. How can one help to get Chiara funding? Yes. Okay. So that one. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Put you in touch with Logan Chipkin. He will help there. Will you have an episode about assembly theory? I mentioned it during a live stream once already. Are there any plans to interview Lee Cronin? No.

When will you appear on Joe Rogan, Lex Fridman? I don't know. There's never been an invitation. What is your opinion about Network Cities and Balaji's Network State book? I think it's great. I think Balaji's idea of a network city is fantastic. It'll be interesting to hear more about it. Any new insights around personhood? Not beyond what I've already said here in this podcast so far. I think a person is a universal explainer, is a creative entity. Beyond that, we don't know. I think that's a significant advance on what we thought about personhood prior to David Deutsch stating that simple fact. Any recent good book you have read? I'm making my way through Dune very slowly. And one of Paul Davies' books where it's just a short series of chapters and discrete chapters. I can't remember the name of it.

### 39m

If you could leave a note to your younger self, what would it be? I was almost going to say question authority, but I already had that. My younger self used to stare at that sticker that my father bought me and I put it on the side of a book. It was an amplifier that I had. And I used to stare at that quite often. So I wouldn't need to say that. This implies that I would change something. I don't think I would. I'm quite happy. Like taken seriously. Taken seriously. If I could leave a note to your younger self, what would it be? Well, you know, how young am I? Year 1990? Well, I would leave, you know, five weeks worth of lotto numbers that would be on the note to my younger self. That's what I would do.

### 40m

Or would I? Because it would change my life significantly. And perhaps I wouldn't be here. And I enjoy doing this. If you would be an advisor for Doge, which error correction mechanism would you strengthen, make sure they keep it intact? Well, I think the whole point of Doge is not to keep stuff intact. Nothing needs to be kept intact. You want a strong military, you want a strong justice system, police force, that kind of thing. But I think Doge is going after that. They're going after the fat, the waste. And so I wouldn't have any advice for Doge on that, apart from remove as much of it as possible. Remove all the regulations. Almost. So, you know, the United States has the best protections around free speech, around free trade, and around the free vote. And they're the three prongs of error correction.

### 41m

And Doge has no indication that it's going to be negatively affecting any of those things. So, yeah, I don't think that's, yeah. I have no advice apart from just keep on doing what they plan on doing. And more of it. How are you doing on convincing David Doge about the true path of leaf tea? We've never actually had the conversation about that. It's just a funny thing that I like to say. I like loose leaf. David has tea bags. What is the biggest misconception you still see around a topic you discuss on the podcast still being present? The biggest misconception, it depends on the area, whether it's physics or epistemology. On physics, it's, you know, the multiverse is still a challenge for people, that it's not testable, even from professional physicists. Professional physicists, even ones who endorse the multiverse,

### 42m

don't realise that it is a testable theory. So there's that. And in epistemology, the idea that, perversely, that Karl Popper was some kind of relativist and that you do need a foundation for knowledge, morality, whatever it happens to be, that knowledge is an edifice requiring firm foundations upon which you build and then derive all of your conclusions. This is the wrong way to think about knowledge, but that's pervasive. And so people don't like the idea of conjectural knowledge. What do you mean you're guessing everything? That's relativist. We must be able to get to the truth. I suppose that is the biggest misconception that we can, utter truth, that we must be able to get to the truth, the final truth. For some reason, people don't like the idea of infinite improvement. They like the idea of getting a final answer, which to me seems like hell. It seems like a terrible idea.

### 43m

A couple of personal questions which I'll just skip past. If you were invited to a talk on a VIP space conference, in Sydney, what would you like to talk about? Well, interestingly enough, Australia has a space agency now, which is interesting, even though we don't have much of a rocket industry, but we have a nascent space industry. Look, I'm not an expert in, you know, I did an astronomy and an astrophysics masters. We did do subjects in rocketry, but I'm no real expert in this. I would talk about, yeah, there's nothing. I would talk about how Elon Musk is doing a very good job

### 44m

and that Mars is another stepping stone off to the rest of the universe. It's interesting, you know, people have been talking about Neil deGrasse Tyson turning on Elon Musk recently. He was on the Bill Maher program, and Neil deGrasse Tyson started talking about how because Mars wouldn't be profitable, going to Mars wouldn't be profitable, Musk had a bad idea about going there because what you needed was a reason such as a geopolitical threat. And, of course, Tyson's thinking about that. And, of course, Tyson's thinking of the reason we went to the moon was largely due to the Cold War, and so the United States was up against Russia and they were engaged in the space race, and that's why we went to the moon. And Neil deGrasse Tyson's theory is that that has to play out with Mars. The only reason we'd go to Mars is if we were competing.

### 45m

There was a geopolitical impetus. To me, that doesn't make any sense. We've always explored further and further. And sometimes just out of interest. Sometimes it's been governments, but, you know, explorers, people go hiking off into the rainforest. You know, we have this impulse. We like exploring. And Musk appears to want to do it just out of interest. So, you know, I would talk about how curiosity drives progress, and people who take steps like Musk does, you know, in order to explore the near or even far reaches of space should be applauded rather than have Rick Batts thrown at them. What is on your bucket list? To not kick it would be one thing. So not dying, that's on my bucket list. Other than that, I don't have a bucket list for exactly that reason.

### 46m

Presumes you're going to die. Is there anything you always wanted but never got around to getting or doing? There's many things like this. I've always wanted to write a book. However, I make podcasts and posts and things, and so I explore my writing in that way. Okay, that's all of Benny Frum's questions. Randy's got three questions. Question one. Can you explain why Deutsch thinks Penrose must be wrong about the phenomenon of explanatory knowledge creation by people requiring non-computation-based activities, actions? Penrose thinks human consciousness and creativity require both computation and non-computation-based activities. Why does that have to be wrong, as I think I heard David Deutsch indicate? I can't speak for David Deutsch. But here I can actually say something about this.

### 47m

Penrose must be wrong given presently understood physics. Now, if presently understood physics is, completely false, or false in a crucial way, then Penrose might be right. But if you take our present theory seriously, namely, all physical processes are computable, then he's wrong. Because that's basically, that's the law of physics. Deeper than the law of physics, it's a principle. All other laws of physics have to conform to that idea. They have to be computable. Now, could it be in the future that we disprove this? Of course. Of course. But at the moment, if you want to be scientific, if you want to be rational by the metric of, let's take our best explanation seriously, in the same way that you would say, you know, there must be a living organism out there somewhere that didn't evolve,

### 48m

that would be a violation of what we understand biological organisms to be. They are evolved entities. They have gone through biological evolution. So to posit an organism that never evolved is, I don't know, just rejecting a good explanation in place of something that there's no reason to hypothesize. And so what Dawkins does, sorry, not Dawkins, what Penrose does is says that consciousness is not computable. But why? Why not just take seriously the idea that all physical processes are computable? That's the Church-Turing-Deutsch principle. It's a principle. It's like saying, what if the next right-angled triangle we find, it's almost like this, what if the next right-angled triangle we find violates Pythagoras' theorem? In stating that, you've stated a contradiction, okay?

### 49m

In the same way, you know, consciousness arises in the universe. You might say it arises in the brain, the mind. It arises in the universe somewhere. Anything, anything that happens in the universe, anything, let me say that again, anything that happens in the universe, from rocks falling off cliffs to waves crashing at the beach to light switches turning on to computers computing and people thinking, anything that happens, consciousness included, is computable. But he just says it's not, you know, his theory is it's not computable. But he has no explanation as to why. It's just to get around this idea that it could possibly be explained by laws of physics alone. But I disagree. I just disagree. Why not take the explanations we have and see where they lead? Maybe they point to answers. You can always say, anyone can always say about anything at all,

### 50m

well, the answer is that present science can't possibly explain this. That could always be the case. It's like UAPs or UFOs. Those things are really aliens, and we can't possibly explain their behavior by using 21st century Earth-based laws of physics. They're using alien technology that is, you know, the successor to the successor of general relativity in order to propel themselves through space. So you've got no hope of trying to understand what's going on. Well, you can always say that about anything, okay, that everything we know is real. That everything we know is completely wrong, and that's the explanation. All right. So that's what I think about Penrose. He's just holding up a thing, consciousness, and saying, this thing, consciousness, it is such a mystery that there's no chance, there's no way, there's no how that it could ever be explained by a process of computation, even though everything else can. Question two. What is the explanation or rationale behind the conjecture

### 51m

that universal explainers are substrate independent? The same way that all knowledge or all software is substrate independent. It's just software that's running. Now, in theory, now, this doesn't mean that the thing itself would be conscious, right? So the universal explainer program, whatever it happens to be, whatever this thing is that is your mind, it's a physical process. That physical process can be captured in an explanation, presumably captured by an algorithm of some kind that would be completely different to any other algorithm because it's creative. All other algorithms are highly deterministic. One input produces basically one output. But the creative algorithm would, you would not be able to predict the output given the input, never. All other algorithms, you would.

### 52m

You want a predictable output given a particular input. Even for random number generators, the predictable output is a number. You don't want anything other than a number. It starts giving you letters, something's gone wrong. So random number generators are still giving you something that you expect. But a creative algorithm gives you something completely different, including, by the way, nothing at all, which is why you can't test for creativity. Because if you have this algorithm that you think might be creative and you type a question to it and nothing comes out, has it malfunctioned? Or is it refusing to answer your question? That's why there's no test, right? You can't, no experiment can distinguish between those two possibilities. But it's also pointless to worry about. It's a red herring because, as I keep saying, we will have the explanation of personhood, of the universal explainer of AGI first, and then we'll have AGI, not the other way around.

### 53m

We won't have AGI trip over it like a rock at the beach and then go, oh, what was that? Let's try and explain it. No, it's the other way around. Now, we, of course, a lot of people come back with, but we evolved after 13.7 billion years of the universe, starting off as a hot soup of subatomic particles, quarks and leptons and things, all the way through to today, to human beings. So that happened once. Why couldn't we simulate that inside of a computer? There's also the problems with that. We can't simulate entire universes inside of a computer. We can't simulate anything near the fidelity of the universe inside of a computer. What we need is a plan. We need a recipe. We need a way of understanding what this explanatory creativity thing is first. So that's the explanation, is that it's a form of knowledge. The explanation of what a universal explainer is is knowledge we don't have yet, but it is knowledge.

### 54m

There's an explanation there. Once we write that down, we could write it down on a piece of paper. We could type it into a computer. We could record our voice. It's substrate independent. And so in theory, you could have that thing running once you actually take the algorithm, and you could run it on a laptop, or you could run it inside of a robot, or you could run it on the wetware of the brain, which is what we're doing right now. We just don't know how to do these things. But in principle, it must be possible because all physical processes are computable. And those physical processes are substrate independent in so far as you're simulating those things. Okay, question three. How does teaching work? If the idea is that each person needs to recreate knowledge instead of being able to receive knowledge as in the bucket theory of the mind, which would require induction, then how do you explain how presenting information, visual, auditory, and other modalities to a person seem to reliably and drastically speed up the creation of knowledge? Question mark.

### 55m

So, yes, teaching the word, it's not a great word because it implies instruction from without. I would reframe the whole term teacher, like my handle on, X is talk teacher. But I've recently thought now that I understand that word, I can change it to mean T-O-K, theory of knowledge, T-E-A. I like T. There it is there. There. I do like a cup of tea. And sure, like the singer. So teacher. These are my three loves. Talk, T, sure. I'm cheating there, aren't I? But what teaching is, ideally, is simply instruction. Now, if you're a student in a classroom and you are told on pain of punishment,

### 56m

or reward, in other words, listen to me, the teacher, and you will get a good mark on the exam. You'll get into the university. Your parents will praise you. You'll earn lots of money. Okay, that's a carrot. So even though you might think that you're pouring information into the mind of the learner as the teacher, you're not. The learner is intrinsically motivated from within. Some are. Some are not. Some will refuse to participate in the lesson. So, of course, presenting information to a person reliably and drastically speeds up the creation of knowledge. It's because people are motivated to do that thing at that time. But you need a control group. People who don't have teachers, people who are outside of schools, for example, they're learning just as fast and just as much about different things, just not the standard curriculum. But how do you compare quantity of information? If little Johnny over there is sitting in a school, in high school,

### 57m

year seven, let's say, and goes through the subjects of history, geography, maths, science and physical education class by the end of the day, they've learned some stuff. They've been told if you don't learn it, you'll fail and you'll be in trouble. If you don't do your work, you'll be kept back after class and, you know, you'll lose your lunchtime. But if you do listen, you'll do well on the exam. You'll end up, by a long chain of reasoning, being rich and successful. That can be motivating to a child, to some children. Now, how do you compare that kid who's learned some things over the course of the day, little Johnny there, to little Jane over here who didn't do any of that? They were homeschooled, but they didn't follow a standard curriculum. They just spent their day learning basket weaving or something. Now, they might have learned a lot about basket weaving.

### 58m

By the end of the day, they might have started off not being able to weave any baskets at all in the morning. By the end of the day, they're an almost perfectly proficient basket weaver. Who's done better? Well, maybe the basket weaving girl, Jane, is really, really happy at the end of the day and is really curious about, I don't know, what those fibres are in the basket, what they're made of, ultimately, chemically speaking, and they become really curious. And the next day after that, they start getting chemistry books out and they start investigating and doing experiments about how to make better baskets out of stronger materials or whatever. Maybe they go off to be a really successful person. No standard curriculum, not taught, just following their own curiosity. So, yeah, that's what teaching is. So I don't agree that necessarily teaching reliably and drastically speeds up the creation of knowledge, even if it seems to. And Randy's admitted it seems to do that. I don't think it does.

### 59m

We need a control group to compare kids who go to school with kids who don't go to school. Another way of putting that is what would have been better for all those many people who succeeded having never gone to university? Should they have stayed at university? Did Elon Musk finish university? I don't know. There's a number of billionaires that kind of never finished their university study. Would it have been better if they did? Presumably not. It would have been better if Einstein had sat in more classes. Instead of becoming a patent clerk and working on relativity, it would have been better if he had have gone back to university and learnt more about Newtonian gravity and why that would have been better. And why that was the correct theory. No, of course not.

### 1h 0m

Wafa has asked my question. One conclusion I've drawn from the theory of optimism is that not making enough progress is the real existential risk. The counterfactual here is that other problems can be solved unless we decide it's too dangerous to attempt solving them, which seems to be the current trend. I would love to hear your thoughts. Well, we can walk and chew gum at the same time, as people say. You can do more than one thing at a time. So, I don't see a contradiction in terms between not making enough progress fast enough and solving multiple problems. We need to do both. We have to make rapid progress all the time. But you're correct to say not making progress fast enough. That's the real issue. And that's what animates me all the time when I'm doing my podcast,

### 1h 1m

is that you need to really rip off the lid of wealth creation, which means ripping off the lid of knowledge creation and creativity broadly, which means undermining things like existing educational institutions, which hamper the growth of knowledge, hamper creativity, teach people all the bad ways of learning and anti-rational means and that kind of thing. So, that, along with anti-pessimism, anti-doomerism, reducing taxation, all of these things which help to enrich companies and individuals to grow, to make progress faster, anything that will make progress faster, and there's a whole bunch of things all the way from education policy, don't have coercive educational environments, through to taxation policy and environment policy, which attracts people as little as possible, concern yourself less with the environment and more with humanity thriving, all that stuff, is what we need in order to avoid the disaster as well as we can.

### 1h 2m

Any time anyone slows down progress, it is basically saying that they know that the disaster is not coming. They can guarantee, they can forestall disaster, but they can't. In order for us to identify the problem fast enough, we need more rapid progress. The analogy is spotting the asteroid in time before it hits the Earth, but that's just an analogy. It could be any number of problems, problems not yet thought of, problems that don't animate the list of things that all scientists say are going to kill us, from climate change through to the superintelligence, through to the next coronavirus, or the next supervolcano or virus, whatever it happens to be. Climate change, of course. Aliens abducting us for our resource.

### 1h 3m

Well, abducting us or just taking the entire planet and using it as a resource in order to power their intergalactic spaceship. All of those things that people talk about, at least they're talking about them. It's the things that we're not yet talking about, the things we haven't yet identified, the problems we haven't discovered yet, but are problems and are coming for us, but we don't know. And we won't know about them in time unless we have rapid progress. Okay. Tim Stevenson. Is the many-worlds interpretation a good argument against the modal ontological argument for God, which relies on the necessity of a possible world in which God exists other than all of the actual worlds? So, that idea of God necessarily existing in all possible worlds, that's the class of all logically possible worlds.

### 1h 4m

So, if it's logically possible, and this is a much larger class or set, if you like, whatever, than the many-worlds interpretation. Many-worlds interpretation is just the ensemble of universes that exist inside the multiverse. Everything that can physically possibly happen, happens somewhere there. But all logically possible universes is obviously much larger than that because it includes all imaginable, conceivable physical laws. But it's more than that, because even if we can't imagine or can't conceive of something, it's still part of the all logically possible universes, right? And in fact, I'd say more than that. There's got to be a superset above that, because what we say is logically possible depends upon what we can possibly think. And what we can possibly think is determined by the laws of physics. So, if the laws of physics were different, what we could think would be different, and what we think is logical would be different as well, which is really a cool idea. I said this during my series on Max Tegmark's stuff,

### 1h 5m

which is when I first thought of that particular idea, that mathematics is different in universes where the laws of physics would be different. Now, these universes, by the way, there's no reason to presume that they exist. This is a higher order of multiverse. We know the multiverse exists. That's quantum theory, it's the multiverse. But sometimes people like Tegmark and others posit that there are universes with different physical laws. Now, if there are such universes with different physical laws, then what you can prove in mathematics would be different as well. In other words, the non-computable functions would be different. Okay, Gödel's incompleteness theorem would not apply there. A different Gödel's incompleteness theorem would apply there, because the laws of physics would be different. And the reason why some things are not computable here or not knowable here, not provable here, is because the laws of physics are such that you can't prove those things here. But if laws of physics were different, then what you could prove would be different.

### 1h 6m

What you could know would be different. And in fact, what you would think would be different. What you would think is logical would be different. So all these things come into play there. So none of this has any effect on God, I don't think, because people will believe in God regardless. But it's independent of what science says. And I think science, by the way, is silent on the matter. That doesn't mean I'm agnostic. I'm atheist. I'm atheist in the same way that I'm atheist about dragons. There are no dragons. There were no dragons. There have never been any dragons. Now, if someone digs up something that looks like a dinosaur tomorrow, but the experts say there appears to be an organ there that was able to generate fire, you know, it was able to repurpose, it was able to burn coal inside of its own stomach and breathe it out, then I'd be convinced there are dragons. But, you know, at the moment, there's no reason. It solves no problem to say there's dragons. It solves no problem to say there's a God.

### 1h 7m

And that's how we refute the notion of God. What problem are you solving? Now, for some people, they have a God-shaped hole. They do have a problem. They really do have a genuine problem. And they fill it with God. Or in some other cases, they fill it with something else. But it's a God-shaped hole. But it's a God-shaped hole, as people say. And that's fine. If that makes you psychologically more comfortable, fill your boots, so to speak. I have no worries about that. Do you believe a version of a... This is from Andy, at Wisely Uncertain. Do you believe a version of a representative democracy offers a society greater opportunity for error correction and progress than anarcho-capitalism? For discussion, consider a version closer to an ideal American system, similar to Popper's description. And then he's linked to Popper's article in The Economist that I've talked about many times before. I regard anarcho-capitalism as kind of the platonic ideal.

### 1h 8m

Anarcho-capitalism, just for anyone who wants to know, is zero government. That's the anarcho bit. And capitalism, where people freely trade with one another. And this is a wonderful idea. Wouldn't it be great if there was no government? You know, proviso is. And no violence at the same time. Now, the anarcho-capitalists say, well, we can have private security firms. But there is no answer to, what if the private security firms disagree? They will say, well, then you have arbitration. OK, so do we have a single arbitrator? No, everyone has their own arbitration. But what if the arbitration people all disagree with one another? I've read a lot of the anarcho-capitalists. There never seems to be an answer to this. The only answer is that, ideally, people are all being perfectly rational. But what one person thinks is rational is different to what another person thinks is rational. So I am, as I always say at this juncture, I am on the anarcho-capitalist side, just as I am on the objectivists, Ayn Rand side,

### 1h 9m

just as I am on the minimal government side, as I am on the Javier Millet side, and so on. The battle is not an internecine war between these people. And even the conservatives. The battle is really against the authoritarian collectivists. So insofar as we need to reduce taxation, reduce regulation, increase personal freedom, allow greater freedom of expression and creativity to flourish, we're all on the same side in that, pushing back against collectivism. Once things improve so much that we've basically eliminated almost all regulations, and we've reduced the tax burden to almost zero, then we can start talking about, should we have anarcho-capitalism, or should we just have a minimal government? Then I'll worry about that. But we're not there yet. So I don't want to get into a fight with my anarcho-capitalist

### 1h 10m

or even conservative or libertarian friends on this. It's just I think we're all on basically the same side for now. But anarcho-capitalism is kind of a platonic ideal that we can aim for off into such a distant future that everything becomes voluntary, including the funding of things like the military. I think even Ayn Rand would agree with at least part of that. She would want to have a government, but in theory you could have a system of voluntary taxation. So why would you bother paying if you didn't have to? Well, that's one kind of personality, right? So why would you bother giving to charity if you didn't have to? It's a certain kind of personality. I get it. From Astazola, the morality offered by David Deutsch seems meta. That is, don't destroy the means of error correction. Doesn't say a lot about decisions facing someone on a day-to-day.

### 1h 11m

I like Ayn Rand's view. It's a lot less meta. Am I not understanding something? I think so, yes. You're not understanding that David Deutsch didn't write a book on morality or personal responsibility or anything like that. He wrote a book, The Beginning of Infinity, largely about an extension of the fabric of reality, epistemology, physics, evolution, particularly of memes and ideas, things like that, and computation and the many-worlds interpretation. So at no point does he give personal advice or talk about morality, you know. He's not giving you a moral guide. So I think that's what you're not understanding, perhaps, about that. I would hope that Ayn Rand would agree with, don't destroy the means of error correction. I guess that she would. I don't know that, although a lot of objectivists

### 1h 12m

are fundamentalists in their outlook, so are some Popperians. They want to know what Popper really said. And let's stick to what Popper really said rather than just making up our own versions of what Popper said or having our own versions of what Popper said. What page number in Conjectures and Refutations did Popper say this particular thing? And if you disagree with that, then you're not a Popperian. You're not an objectivist unless you believe what Ayn Rand said here on page 54 of Capitalism, The Unknown Ideal, or here in Atlas Shrugged or whatever it happens to be. You should be able to be an objectivist and not be pure, but there is a purity test in objectivism that I have an issue with because if you're not all the way with Rand, then what do they call you? Well, they label you mixed. That's the best thing you can hope for if you're not an objectivist.

### 1h 13m

Worse, you're an enemy. So, yes. Vish has asked, I've heard David mention there are a few unsolved problems in the theory of evolution that need to be solved before we head to research on AGI creativity. What are they? I don't know that he says that they need to be solved before research on AGI creativity, but there are unsolved problems in the theory of evolution. There's a whole bunch of things. I talk about this in the podcast series in the beginning of Affinity. You can't simulate evolution. We don't have the wherewithal to figure out how mutations of genes in a given environment are actually selected for or selected against. You can do evolutionary algorithms, but they don't resemble what real evolution is doing because evolutionary algorithms already have a teleology, an aim.

### 1h 14m

So, for the example that David gave, that David uses in the beginning of Affinity, is robotic legs. Now, if you've got these robotic legs, even if they're just simulated robotic legs, and you use an evolutionary algorithm to get the robotic legs to walk, you have an aim. You start off with legs and then you iterate and iterate and iterate and you have a criterion for success. Namely, is the thing able to walk? So it starts to get up and it stumbles over and it walks a few more steps and it stumbles over and eventually it's walking and then it's running and then it's dancing. And you go, I've got an evolutionary algorithm. Proof that I've simulated evolution. But that's not what evolution is. Evolution is not teleological like that. In other words, it doesn't have an aim. You had an aim. The programmer had an aim. I want these legs to walk or run or dance, something. And I'm going to write a program so that it achieves that aim. But evolution is not doing that.

### 1h 15m

True Darwinian evolution is not doing that. It's not aiming for something. The monkeys are not aiming to become human. The caterpillars and the butterflies are not aiming to become birds. There's nothing like that going on. Everything just evolves. How? By natural selection. Random mutation of genes that are selected for the selfish genes. We can't simulate that. So that's the thing that needs to be solved. How is it that this process works without having an aim? The complexity increases. We don't know. Rational optimist. What do you think are the differences and similarities of Taleb's and Deutsch's works? Well, they're both fans of Karl Popper. I've only read The Black Swan when it comes to Taleb, and I'm not inclined to read any more of his work. And I'm less likely now.

### 1h 16m

I just don't find anything that he's written and said particularly insightful. I think he's made a lot of predictions over the years that have gone significantly awry. Wasn't his latest one that was publicized or thrown around on X that Bitcoin is destined to go the way of the dinosaur? It's a terrible investment and no one should take cryptocurrency seriously. It appears that he's been proven quite wrong on that. But I don't imagine he's going to admit being proved wrong. He'll say, one day it's coming, one day the complete collapse of Bitcoin is coming, and then you'll see that I'm right. He likes to make a lot of prophecies. And so I don't... People who make prophecies like that and have a very rigid, I would say, way of thinking are quite antagonistic towards the way

David thinks. I think they're very, very different people, even though both of them are very, very different people. Well, Taleb claims to be a fan of Karl Popper. But I don't see the kind of fallibilism focus in Taleb's work. A lot of people say they're fans of Karl Popper and don't necessarily understand what conjectural knowledge is. A speciesist has said, congrats brother, I've been grappling with this idea for months and still can't wrap my head around it. Other times are instances of other universes. Well, this is what I talked about earlier. The fundamental thing in quantum theory, the fundamental entity in quantum theory is the multiverse. The multiverse is what exists. That's it. Whatever this thing is, the multiverse, it consists of everything that has happened and will happen. All physically

### 1h 18m

possible things. So, when you divide that up into universes, some of the universes happen at the same time and some of the universes happen an instant later and an instant later and an instant later. So, yesterday is different to today, which is different to tomorrow. They're all different universes. And there's universes essentially beside me right now where I'm doing something slightly different, ever so slightly different to what I'm doing now. Maybe some place where I'm drinking tea, somewhere I'm drinking coffee, rather than just water, which is what I have here. And so, these are the universes where I'm doing different things right now, are other universes. But, just a moment ago, when I was talking about drinking tea and coffee, that's also a universe. So what is a universe then? A universe is an approximately autonomous region of the multiverse. What does that mean? It's complicated. The fundamental thing to focus on is the multiverse exists. And then there are certain ways of dividing that up into universes and sometimes the universes are small, sometimes they're as large as the cosmological universe happens to be.

### 1h 19m

So, the word universe has to be re-understood within this Everettian quantum theory idea. Andy, again, did you find David Deutsch's response to Yor and Navarre's questions regarding parenting full stop? There's no question there. Today it appears as if a parent does not intentionally guide a child, they are likely to fall victim to corporations, harmful addictions, or any anti-rational means that can hurt them for life. Well, that's always been the case, that people can fall victims to anti-rational means that can hurt them for life. We always had. It's hard to know where to begin. When people talk about taking children seriously, it's just all that you're saying with taking children seriously is you just have a relationship with the child where it's non-coercive.

### 1h 20m

It's analogous to the relationship that you have with your spouse or your partner. You're not going to demand that they do something. You're going to have a conversation and talk to them about it and come to a mutual agreement. You're not just giving in to the child and the child is not walking over you or whatever it happens to be. You are together problem-solving. You're there to help the child. So when you say intentionally guide a child, and if you don't intentionally guide a child, they're going to form harmful addictions. I don't agree with that. Corporations are not evil. They're not trying to addict anyone to anything. Kids find certain things fun. So what you're hinting at there is that unless you intentionally guide the child away from the iPhone or the iPad, they're going to do something evil with it and become addicted. No. People used to say the same things about books, by the way. There's that great account on X

### 1h 21m

called Pessimist's Archive. Look up that one. Parents used to say that they didn't want their children to read books for fear that the books would warp their minds with bad ideas. Children should not be allowed to learn to read. And now we've changed things too, thanks to Jonathan Haidt among other people. The evil social media corporations and screens and so on. It's just a very ancient idea, I suppose. Technology's bad. That's all they're saying. That's all they're saying. Boo technology. There will be another thing beyond social media in ten years from now. There'll be something else. Our own government here is making laws, wanting to make laws about what they say is they want to protect children. Protect children online so they want to be the world first in banning social media for anyone under the age of 16. That's literally

### 1h 22m

what they're trying to do in Australia. I don't know if it's going to pass through the parliament. This is what they're planning on doing. And a lot of others are saying, on the conservative side, well, they come to you as parents with this friendly sounding, we're going to help you because we know your children are addicted. That's what the government are saying, the left leaning government are saying. We know your children are addicted to social media so we, the government, will come along and we'll ban social media and so therefore it's taken out of your hands and so you can just point to the law and say it's against the law for you to use X or Facebook or whatever. Now, how do you prove that you're over 16? Well this is a great issue for the other side of the government, the parliament. The opposition are saying, well the only way to do that is to have a universal system of identification where everyone has to upload their ID to a central database to prove their age and it doesn't matter who you are. So this is something, you know, this big government idea, this big monitoring

### 1h 23m

censorship kind of thing that people are now realising. This bill which is supposed to protect children is perhaps just another way of government trying to reach into what you're doing online. To control what's happening online. And Australia is unfortunately one of the worst countries in the world when it comes to authoritarian clampdowns of technology of all kinds. Whether it's nuclear energy or social media. Oh well. Um So I'm just looking through any other things that are on X I can go now to what's been said on YouTube. Sarosh, as per the many worlds interpretation I'm curious to know what

### 1h 24m

to what extent can two universes differentiate. For example, can a person be alive in one universe and dead in another? Yes. Yes. But two universes if our universe splits in two the correct way of thinking about that the better way of thinking about that is that our universe actually consists of infinitely many fungible instances. All the same. So right now, there are infinitely many versions of me doing exactly what I'm doing right now. An instant later, they can differentiate into two infinitely many fungible sets. If you like, sets or classes. Depends upon the mathematics. So there are two groups now only very slightly different. Both of them are infinite. And so no matter how often you cut this thing in half, there's still infinitely many. And you go, how can there still be infinitely many? Well if I have you know, here's a

### 1h 25m

here's one foot approximately one foot thirty centimeters, twelve inches, whatever you want to call it. There are infinitely many points between this hand and that hand. Infinitely many points. And if I divide it in two, I have infinitely many points here and infinitely many points there. I don't have fewer points in either. They have the same measure, we say. So you can divide up an infinite set infinitely many times and still be left with infinity. So that's the way that works. So if you could divide, there's a universe where I'm alive here, and there's a universe where I suddenly die for whatever terrible reason. The one where, as I am here now, there is a universe somewhere where I just died. There is. There is really one there, because it's physically possible that it could have happened, so it did happen somewhere. There's no law of physics that at the moment I must be able to die, and so therefore I did, somewhere.

### 1h 26m

But that was a copy of me. That's not me. I'm conscious here of this. This is going on. This is your conscious of what's going on with you. Even though versions of you have gone to do something else, but a version of you is not you. Okay? A version of you doing something different is not you. It's just a copy of you. It's no more you than your twin happens to be. And Sarosh has gone on. And as people age, instances of the same person dying would increase across the universes. How long can that go on for? There's no upper limit. We could be immortal. Hopefully you and I are part of the group of people that goes on to live forever. That'd be nice. Or at least goes on to live for as long as you want. Goes on to live for as long as you want. So there is no physical law placing an upper bound on your age is the better way to say that. So this can go on forever.

### 1h 27m

Unless we discover a new law of physics that says people must die. But there can be no such law because problems are soluble. One aspect this is from Tornado Eye. One aspect of taking children seriously that I find difficult of defending in discussions is the addictive nature of some video games and high calorie foods. How should TCS parents think of such problems? Question mark. There's no such thing as addiction to certain high calorie foods or video games. Fact. Do some people engage in behaviours which are bad for their health? Yes. Do they make bad decisions again and again? Yes. What is the worst thing you could do as a parent to ensure that kids have an obsession with sugar? Deny them sugar. Deny them sugar. Kids love lollies because they're told they're not supposed to eat them. But I

### 1h 28m

know personally of people who were free to eat, and I know people now who raise their kids this way, the kids are free to eat whatever they like, as much as they like. And they don't eat much more sugar than any other kid. In fact, they eat less because they don't see it as a rare treat. If you see it as a rare treat, then you think this is a reward. I only get this on special occasions. So then when you're old enough and you've got enough money to do what you want, then you buy all this sugar and you become addicted to sugar, or video games, or whatever it happens to be, that you were denied as a child. So that's what I think about that. So what you would say, what I would say is if I'm in a discussion with someone who doesn't agree with the idea that you should take your child seriously, if the child wants sugar, let them have sugar, if the child wants to play video games, let them play video games, is the very act of denying them that thing is the thing that causes them to want to do it more.

### 1h 29m

That's the nature of humanity. People want the thing they're told they're not allowed to have. People are disobedient. That's one of the criteria for being a person. So, yeah, you end up with hang-ups, as we say. You'll end up with a hang-up. If a parent tells a child not to do the thing, without having a good reason, but just, I told you so, because I said so, or because it's bad for your health, and I know what's best for you. It's not like don't keep walking that way, or you'll walk in front of a bus, or you'll walk over a cliff. That's different. If a kid's walking towards the road, and the bus is coming down the road, and you grab them by the arm to pull them back from being hit by the bus, they will thank you for it. They don't intend to die. That's not coercion. If they're running towards a cliff, and you tackle them before they run off the cliff, they'll thank you. Unless they were intending on jumping into the water and having a good time.

### 1h 30m

These are very different things. The child doesn't want to die. So stopping them from going in front of the bus is good, and they'll thank you for it. The child, if you talk to them about, if you eat too many of these sweets, it's bad for your health. And, you know, we can talk about that. Have your Maltesers, have your Mars bar, have your Frosty Flakes, whatever it happens to be. Fill your boots. But while you're doing that, let's have a discussion about what sugar does to you. People get very fat if they eat too much sugar. People feel lethargic sometimes too. You'll notice this. Have all the Maltesers and see how you feel in half an hour. See if you feel better or you feel worse. See if you feel sick. Eat 10, see how that feels. Eat 20, see if you get bored of eating Maltesers. See if you get bored of eating Maltesers.

### 1h 31m

Whatever it happens to be. So, yeah. Reid has said, congrats on the downloads milestone. Thank you, Reid. And thank you for putting me in touch with Peter. HowlGoBoy, do you know about the jute box theory of meaning? I don't. No. Tell me about it. Give us an update regarding your working relationship with Naval. Do you guys have a plan? We always have plans. We always have things in the pipeline, you've asked. Yes, we always do. But we don't like to talk about them. We like to keep it on the down low as commercial in confidence and all that kind of stuff. But we will continue what we can promise. We continue to promote the optimistic world view that I hope has just had a jet pack put under it by the seismic shifts in what is going on in the

### 1h 32m

United States. Whether you like Donald Trump or not, this idea of having a businessman, businessmen, like Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk advising the government on how to reduce government spending and the size of government departments, fantastic. And his picks and the picks for the administration and all the changes that are promised. All I can say is we will see. We will see. You can only judge a politician on two criteria. One, what they say. And next, what they do. So if they say they're going to do X and they don't do X, they've failed. If they say they're going to do X and they achieve X, wonderful. Round of applause. You've actually achieved the thing you said. Even if other people disagree with that. Because that's what they promised before the election. You don't want to say, and people keep on saying, Trump has a mandate. We've had this in Australia before as well. People are claiming you have a mandate.

### 1h 33m

Mandate me. When it comes to politics, there are checks and balances in place, and they are robust in the United States. They're very robust. And once people are there, knowing knowing full well that Donald Trump has this final four years, he's not an all-powerful dictator. He cannot be. And so the Senate, even though it's ruled by Republicans, those Senators, they can stay for longer than four years. And they may want to stay for longer than four years, so it may be in their interest that if Trump tries to do something that they disagree with, including in the Congress, that they may decide to deny him the capacity of doing that. Part of the checks and balances. So, I'm optimistic about what's going to happen in the United States over the next four years. Not just because Trump might do a whole bunch of things, but also because the entire government apparatus of the United States has changed in such a way

### 1h 34m

that we will see change. And I think that we want to have seen change, in particular with the swamp or the bureaucracy. I think that's the thing where Trump learned from his first term that he wasn't able to enact much change. And I'm not one for bureaucrats. I don't like bureaucracies. I think they are immune to criticism. They are a way of violating Popper's criterion where they rule, they can issue edicts, they can issue everything from fines to make up new regulations, no one voted for. Chief health officers were a perfect case in point there. Where during COVID, the chief health officers around the world, the unelected bureaucrats, were able to say we are going to implement this particular restriction on your freedom. Why? Because this is the best available science. And then they would also say, in basically the same breath, but it is ultimately the politician who decides this. Now what does the politician do? The politician then says

### 1h 35m

well this is the best scientific advice that we have, so I have to defer to the authority of science. So no one was ultimately responsible. Terrible violation of Popper's criterion. So that kind of thing was illuminated in neon lights during COVID and everyone noticed, oh look at the power these bureaucrats have. But many of us had known that the bureaucrats behind the scenes had always had this kind of power and have this way of eating away at your freedoms through regulations, especially the regulations that business has to go through. So maybe that will be reduced. The power of the bureaucrats. So I'm optimistic about it and I think Naval was optimistic about it and a lot of people in the United States are very optimistic about that aspect of things. Unburdening business from regulation and bureaucracy. Goat has asked, Brett, when my friends ask what is experimental confirmation of any world, what should I say? I believe worlds do exist but it can be a different structure.

### 1h 36m

First you would say there is no such thing as experimental confirmation of anything. Of anything. You're not confirmed. All you can do is to distinguish between different theories guessed. So there is an experimental test of the many worlds interpretation. You can type it in, many worlds interpretation experimental test, Brett Hall or TopCast on YouTube and you'll find the test. I go through it in about 20 minutes. I'm not going to recapitulate that here now. So you'd first say there's no such thing as experimental confirmation but you can do an experiment to rule out the collapse idea. The wave function collapse idea for example. And that leaves you with the only known explanation. The only known explanation. The many worlds interpretation. Goat has also said, Brett you mentioned

### 1h 37m

AI disobeying. The open AI thought it malfunctioned. Can you elaborate more on if it is AI? I'm not sure. I don't know what that means. A few more things. I'm just trying to Goat has asked a series of questions. People can check in the chat to see whether or not I should answer them. I'm not going to answer all of these things. He has asked, how do Papyrians like to should use approach abductive arguments? Abduction is a fancy word for guess. There's no such thing. This is something made up by academic philosophers. Academic philosophers like to talk about deduction, and then induction, and then abduction. I'm not going to talk about that.

### 1h 38m

It's the more recent fashionable term. Abduction is just jargon for guess. That's all. Someone else has asked, how would a Papyrian express the criticism that a theory goes too far beyond the evidence? Example, one could explain unfamiliar animal tracks by proposing some fantastic creature left to them. Yes. The thing is that if you were to suppose that unfamiliar animal tracks were made by a fantastic creature, a fantasy creature, and not an already known animal, it raises more questions than it solves. You can just say, I don't know what this animal is. That's a legitimate answer. But it looks like a horse, or it looks like a donkey, rather than a winged senator

### 1h 39m

or a winged unicorn or something like that. Those winged horse-like creatures raise more questions than they answer. How is this winged creature with the body mass of a horse able to fly? How big are the wings? Why have we never seen one flying through the air? Many questions are raised. Whereas if you just say, ah, those hoof prints look very horse-like, maybe it's a zebra. Simple. Yeah. How would a Popperian express the criticism that a theory goes too far beyond the evidence? Well, the evidence is the explicanda, we say, is the technical way of talking about that. It's the thing to be explained. So when we look outside and you can see the sun shining, that's evidence. Evidence of what? The sun. Existing sun. I see sunlight. There must be a sun up there. What's a sun? It's a star. What's a star? It's this sphere of mainly

### 1h 40m

hydrogen, this fusing hydrogen nuclei, protons, into ultimately helium. Until it runs out of hydrogen to do that, and then it starts fusing the helium, and so on it goes. Um, yeah. Chris, why do you think so many people I speak to about various topics that David Deutsch explores in the Fabric of Reality and Begin Infinity cannot understand why people would bother asking these kind of questions? Well, people have different interests, Chris. Um, yeah. Yes, I hear this. You know, why bother? Why bother contemplating that? Who cares about the many worlds interpreted? Fair enough. You can have that opinion. You can have an opinion about anything. Who cares about the nature of mathematics? Why are you worried? Why are you worried about mixed martial arts? I don't care. Why are you worried about baseball? Pick the thing, okay? I'm interested in certain kinds of philosophy, existential questions,

### 1h 41m

big questions, the big questions of life, the universe, and everything. Other people are interested in learning new dance routines. I don't judge them. Yeah. Um, but I guess one way you could respond is that we're trying to understand progress. We're trying to understand how to make things better for everyone, everywhere more rapidly. Uh, we want to cure all disease. We want to have better computers to make life more comfortable so that everyone's wealthier, healthier, happier. Um, Chris, what conditions must exist for knowledge to grow indefinitely, and how can we improve our system to ensure this growth continues? Big question. Um, we need a tradition of criticism. So one thing, that has to be preserved. So we have to preserve the means of error correction. How can we improve our system so we

### 1h 42m

ensure that growth continues? Well, accidents can always happen. So even if we do have these great institutions that protect free speech, free trade, and free vote, even if we do, you could still be wiped out by an asteroid, or a nearby supernova, or a catastrophic virus, or whatever it happens to be. So we can't guarantee that knowledge will grow indefinitely. But to give us our best chance, we have to maintain the traditions of the Enlightenment. People must be free to speak their minds free speech. They must be free to trade with one another without a third party getting involved. That's capitalism. And they must be able to vote out the people who are in charge, the rules, rulers, and change the rules of the game when they want to, and that's democracy. So as long as you keep protecting those things, growth will continue. And those things entail a commitment to science, mathematics, philosophy, epistemology, and rationality broadly, reason broadly.

### 1h 43m

Donal Troy, thank you to Ed for the donation. Donal said, you should have a conversation with David Shapiro. His YouTube channel is full of videos with misconceptions about these LLM models and how they are close to becoming conscious. Yeah, well, he's in good company. I don't hear many people there's a lot more now, but echoing the kind of things that myself, Naval, and David have said. I began with David talking about this stuff and explaining what the nature of personhood is and therefore what the nature of creativity is and universal explainer and all this sort of stuff. As for, you know, LLMs becoming, getting close to becoming conscious, well, they don't know what conscious is. No one knows what consciousness is. So how they know that they're getting close to it, I don't know. The Turing test was never a good test for anything.

### 1h 44m

It wasn't a good test for personhood. It was a good test for a system that could have a conversation with you. So that test has been passed. No one knows what AGI is exactly. They don't have the recipe for it, so they can't possibly say how close we are to getting there. Prajwal, what's your opinion on David Booth's evolutionary psychology? I don't know and I'm not aware of it. What is your end goal or motivation after gaining this valuable knowledge? I have no end goal. There's no goal. There's no goal. I did a live stream once, in fact, on this about why you shouldn't live a goal-driven life. Once you set yourself up with goals, then you set yourself up for either succeeding in the goal, in which case

### 1h 45m

you'll feel deflated. Like you get the gold medal and then forever after everything is downhill from there because you've achieved the goal. Or you'll fail to achieve the goal, in which case you'll feel bad. So in either way, either case you feel bad. Don't have goals. Just have a mindset of problem solving. And each time you solve a problem, it'll open up a whole bunch of new problems for you to achieve. You might say, that is goal, setting a goal. Solving the problem is setting a goal. Not really because you hear people write this idea of, you're going to write down your dreams on your dream board and say this is what you want to have by the time you're 25 and then 35 and you know if you don't achieve it, you'll be a failure. Well, defining things in terms of success and failure is already wrong. What you want is to have fun with life. And that is a problem of how to find ever more fun things. But it's not a problem that causes suffering. It's just a problem that leads to ever more interesting problems.

### 1h 46m

Do you know of Lee Smolin, chemist in Glasgow, Scotland? Well, I know of Lee Smolin, the physicist, who's a different person, obviously. Oh. No. Lee Cronin is what you're saying. Do you know Lee Cronin? Of course I do. Assembly theory where everything can be assigned an assembly number. How does that theory interplay with Deutsch's constructive theory? I've answered that on previous Livestreams. It's too long to go through again now. Um. Yeah, but basically, I have looked into it at length. Unfortunately, he hasn't dealt with the existing criticisms from mathematicians who have said and shown that assembly theory, as it is originally conceived, is just a rediscovery of an existing mathematical compression algorithm.

### 1h 47m

That's all that the assembly number amounts to. A recapitulation of an existing mathematical theorem about how to compress things like the complexity of molecules and assign them a number. Now, as for the rest of it, I'm not impressed. It's not a theory of the possible and impossible. He has taken what could have been a modest proposal about the complexity of molecules in chemistry. Fair enough. Even if it was a rediscovery of an existing mathematical compression algorithm. Even if it was just that. How on earth can that be used to explain the origins of life and the universe and time and all this stuff? I don't know. I'm not buying it. He makes pronouncements on X regularly about how he's just about to prove this thing. I've said to him recently, I'm looking forward to the proof.

### 1h 48m

I can't wait until this paper gets published. The paper never gets published. Enright. Is it ever possible we could have the knowledge that it is actually true, even though we wouldn't know it is actually true? Could 2 plus 2 equals 4 be unmitigantly true? Truth is a property of propositions, but we cannot utter propositions. 2 plus 2 equals 4 is a statement. It is a claim about necessary truth without itself being necessarily true. What does that mean? We can always be mistaken. The realm of mathematics can be represented The realm of mathematics is necessary truth or if you want to say numbers. But as David says in The Fabric of Reality, necessary truth is the subject matter of mathematics, not the reward you get for doing mathematics. So what you've got there on the screen is 2 plus 2 equals 4 is a set of numerals and symbols that mean something to you. It's a statement.

### 1h 49m

Now, statements can be approximations to propositions which do have truth values, but that doesn't have a truth value. But what I would say is no explanation is improved by denying the truth of that statement. So of course you would say, does 2 plus 2 equals 4? Yes, it does. Yes it does. And I would argue all day long with someone who says that it doesn't. There is that silly joke that for sufficiently large values of 2, 2 plus 2 does not equal 4. So for example, 2.4 plus 2.4 is 4.8, which is 5. Rounding all these things. 2.4 rounded is 2. Take 2 of those, put them together, you get 4.8 which is 5. But that's silly. Thank you Alex, just thanking me. Last question. What is your view on depression, anxiety and panic attacks? Is there a way to solve that problem in your

### 1h 50m

eyes? Now a good person to look up on X on this is Michael Golding. He's a Popperian psychiatrist. There's not many of those around you. I think he's the only one. And I would agree with him that there are versions of each of those things you've mentioned. So with depression, anxiety and panic attacks, they could be the consequence purely of bad ideas. So depression for example, could be a consequence of someone repeatedly being thwarted in trying to achieve something and that would make you depressed. You want to be a basketballer but you keep on failing. You just can't get the ball in the hoop. That might lead to depression. If you're dead set on becoming a famous basketballer but you're just terrible at it, that could lead to depression. Now how do you solve that? Well you solve that by going to a counselor or a psychologist or talking to a friend or a family member or someone you care about who cares about you and sorting this out. Figuring out that you don't really

### 1h 51m

want to be a basketballer. You say you do and you might even feel it to some extent but really let's face it, you're not going to be a great basketballer. You're not a great basketballer. You're not improving and the reason you're not improving is because you don't really want that. So let's talk about what you really need and then in solving that problem, getting over that, the problem is solved. Same with anxiety. People who are afraid of spiders being slowly, gradually exposed to spiders, getting ever closer to spiders, can lose the anxiety. Now that's all true. This is the function of counselors. It's also the function of friends and having functional relationships. On the other hand, I agree with Michael. There are certain people for whom their brain chemistry is such that they do need interventions with chemicals that can modulate the action of neurotransmitters. That's also true. Two things can be true at once. That dichotomy that I just mentioned to you and people are over medical

### 1h 52m

people are over prescribed a whole bunch of psychoactive drugs. So for example, the whole idea of giving children Ritalin or whatever it happens to be, some sort of drug because they have ADHD so they have they can't pay attention for long enough in class. Well yeah, because class is boring. A lot of stuff that kids are forced to do when they're young is boring. Medicalizing that is a terrible sin, I would say. It's terribly wrong. It's immoral. Not everyone who's sad should be given Prozac. Not everyone who's anxious should be given Xanax or whatever it happens to be. You should at first, okay, this is why there are such things as professionals here like Michael Golding that you would go to if you had this problem coming up, and he would talk to you. These psychologists and counselors and psychiatrists if you don't have friends or family members who can help you, will talk to you first. And only after a

### 1h 53m

very long series of conversations will they figure out, okay, this is chemically wrong in your brain. This is why you feel the way you do. You might have everything, especially people who have everything going well in their lives, okay, billionaires with good families and whatever, but might still be depressed. And there have been cases of this. And they get medicated and they do feel a lot better. One person I listen to a lot is Conan O'Brien. I like his podcast. It's very funny. So if I'm having some downtime, I listen to Conan O'Brien. It's called Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend. Anyway, he talks about how he's got a wonderful life and what the part of his mind that makes him so funny and so energetic and whatever else also causes him to go through periods of great depression and anxiety. And so he didn't ever want to take drugs. He was worried it was going to affect his comedy timing and all that sort of thing, his creativity. And it did. So he had to

figure out what drug would allow him to still be as creative as ever, while at the same time causing him not to feel depressed because his natural state of his brain was half the time he was up and really, really happy and funny and the rest of the time he was down. So he managed to fix that with drugs. So I think that's the rare exception, but those people exist. But for the majority of people who are depressed, I think it's just a it's an issue of being watered. In other words, you wanting something to happen and it doesn't happen, you wanting to have more money than what you do, you wanting to lose weight, you wanting to have a particular relationship, you wanting to not have that person die, you wanting to achieve certain goals in your life, and if those things happen or don't happen in a way that you didn't want them to, then that can cause depression and anxiety. Worrying about the future, being concerned about the past, these are all things that are

can cause anxiety. And a lot of it is just to do with your thinking. Your thinking will cause these things, and this is something contemplatives figured out a long time ago. That once you are in the present moment, you will not regret the past or fear the future. So you won't feel regretting the past is depression, fearing the future, anxiety. If you can center yourself in the present moment, all you're thinking about is right now. And you're not concerned about either future you or past you. You're just here and now. And in that state, you won't be depressed or anxious because you're just here now. Unless you have a chemical imbalance. Okay, last of all, do you think Australia will be a livable country for humans in say 100 years as it is too hot and humid? No, I don't. I think Australia will be eminently more livable than ever in 100 years. It'll be a lot better. The whole world will be a lot

better. All I can say is just you wait. And on that, thank you everyone. And from Australia, good night and for a lot of other people, good morning and good evening wherever you happen to be. Bye bye.
