Monarchy. It is no accident the United Kingdom has an unusual history in terms of a strange coupling of dynamism and stability. Often these two things are in tension or even apparent conflict. Something stable remains the same, so usually cannot be dynamic, for dynamism tends to cause instability. While we cannot attribute this entirely to the existence of a constitutional monarchy, we cannot completely ignore it either. The British parliamentary system, known as the Westminster system, is inherited by many democratic nations to a greater or lesser extent, but it's never yet been improved upon. Political dynamism involves great swings in terms of ideas, ideologies, leaders and outlooks. The metaphorical great swing of a pendulum, but a pendulum is not a pendulum at all if it is not anchored at its pivot. The pivot does not move. In a real sense, a parliament is the pendulum. A simple pendulum swings side to

side, while a double pendulum, a pendulum attached to a pendulum, can do that and far more, displaying so-called chaotic motion, which is really just extremely complex and impossible to predict behavior. In both cases, simple or double, the pendulum is anchored to the immovable pivot. The pivot is like the monarchy, immovable, stable. The monarchy and Britain and the Commonwealth acts as a so-called head of state. In Australia, the position is figurative, with the monarch's powers invested in the position of governor-general. But a queen or king in this system are not rulers in the sense they make no rules, unlike the politicians. Monarchs suggest no policy and have no authority to make any. Indeed, should the parliament itself stop moving and be unable to do its job of making the rules, the government itself becomes motionless, like the pivot. A technical example of this is when

the opposition parties blocked the supply of money to the government in Australia in 1975. The power of the monarchy, through the governor-general, was able to get the whole thing moving again by dismissing the government of the day. This is known as the use of the monarchs, or their representatives, reserve powers. In Australia, the one time that has ever happened remains controversial. To today, the crown is the dignified, and the parliament is the efficient, wrote Walter Baycott in his 1867 work, The English Constitution. This distinction between the dignified and the efficient separates out the almost entirely symbolic part of the system versus the way things are actually achieved. In modern science-type language, the crown is the constant, and the parliament is the variable. There are differences we can observe in the real world. There are differences we can observe in the real world between the British system and other places.

For example, in continental Europe, countries like France, with its violent revolution in the past and its more concentrated power in their presidency, or Germany, Spain, and Italy, with their falls into fascism and more modern tendency to favor more collectivist or authoritarian solutions. Such leaps to extremism and authoritarianism of various kinds have not plagued Britain to the same extent. Though there has been revolution, the republic was short-lived, and a return to the constitutional monarchy swift. The rule is Britain is stable and yet dynamic. It is stable while undergoing rapid change, rapid progress. This occurs because of a particular kind of tradition, a tradition of criticism, that originated in Britain and remains there as the preeminent example of it, politically and culturally. They are, the British, from the highest God's eye view, typically not triumphant. They are not trying to find the once and for all right answer, or the once and for all good leader

to be installed and make things finally right. There is no finally right, only incremental progress. There need be no final perfect law. It is rather a scientific approach to politics theirs, as Popper explained through the parallels he drew between those disciplines, parallels between democracy and science. The distinction between science and non-science, and between good democratic institutions. The distinction between science and non-science, and between good democratic institutions and their opposite. An institution is judged by Popper to be democratic to the extent it allows its rules and rulers to be removed most easily without violence. But again, the monarch is not a ruler in that sense for they do not make rules. That institution is the pivot around which the change occurs, and there needs to be a pivot. Without it there is no structure at all, no tension, no movement, and no progress. In Australia. all the authority of the monarch in terms of so-called reserve powers is invested in the governor-general who is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the government of the day.

But the monarchy, which in the Australian nation means the queen or king of England, is actually also the queen or king of Australia, a constitutional monarchy maintains the constant stability, allowing for the changes parliament brings. To remove that stability, to remove that very thing that has facilitated our dynamic society, would be dangerous, especially if experimenting with an unknown, like, for example, a directly elected president in Australia, which is what some people have suggested. Because then we'd have two seats of power, two rulers, the parliament and an elected president, elected presumably based on a contest between candidates with opposing policies politicising the head of state position. A constitutional monarchy generates stability because of inexplicit knowledge, memes, instantiated into the very fabric of the system. We do not understand all the reasons why this particular system works so well, rather like

we do not know all the reasons why science allows progress to be made. The point is, they both do work, and as ways of doing things, both have proven themselves over and again when tested against reality. Science can help explain why progress occurs, the rapid change we are now all used to. But at the same time, something like a constitutional monarchy, a Westminster parliamentary system of democracy, also explains why this rapid change does not cause great instability, as rapid change has caused in the past to other civilisations. Because the stability is deeply embedded as a system of ideas, memes, inexplicably often in complex, resilient institutions. And the monarchy is one such.
