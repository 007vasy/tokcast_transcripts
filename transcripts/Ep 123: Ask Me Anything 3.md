Welcome to TalkCast and for an impromptu Ask Me Anything episode. I was interviewed just yesterday by Iona Italia who is the editor of Arrayo magazine and the link to that magazine is in the description to this video. It was a great conversation, it took a lot of meandering turns and unfortunately I didn't get to most of the questions that were asked of me on Twitter and so I thought I'd make up for it by doing this particular episode. Arrayo magazine is all about progress and humanism and science and philosophy and is well worth your looking into and your support if you can. So again link in the description for that. I should say I like these Ask Me Anything episodes. This is the third one that I've done and I like them because they're very little effort on my part. I don't have to go preparing anything like with all my other episodes. that are devoted to books and particular ideas and exploration of those ideas. I can just sit down

### 1m

and treat it kind of like an interview where people are asking me questions on Twitter and I just answer them off the top of my head. So no preparation and I guess very little editing unless I really stuff up along the way. So without further ado let's get into the questions and the first one is asked by Arjun Kamani who is a prolific writer and tweeter but particularly writer on Substack. He has a wonderful little magazine happening there, a blog kind of thing. Well worth checking out. Links in the description. He's just also started a podcast and I've been interviewed by Arjun recently for his podcast. And Arjun asks, why are problems inevitable? You know that's a great one. So often this is treated, this question or this statement rather, this claim problems are inevitable is kind of treated as almost axiomatic. I guess in a sense it is but all axioms have an explanation for it. So I'm going to start with the axiomatic. I'm going to start with the axiomatic. There's a reason for thinking them or reason for thinking that they are good starting points. You

### 2m

can have any old starting point that you like but these ones are particularly good. This idea of problems being inevitable. Why are problems inevitable? Well my answer would be because we exist. Human beings, people exist and basically that's it. That's why problems are inevitable. We human beings create knowledge and that knowledge is error prone and because of those errors we can only survive by correcting them in the long run. Now more broadly you might say that problems are inevitable because life exists. Because life exists there are problems and only, well only people kind of have problem situations really. Only people can have problems. So once you've got a universe with people in them, people in it rather, then you've got problems in that universe because people encounter problems. So maybe the question is why do people find problems inevitable? Okay in a universe without people there might not be problems. Although you might argue that other animals could encounter problems. Individuals of a species I guess have

### 3m

this instinct to survive. So perhaps that's a problem situation of a kind or perhaps maybe just the genes have a problem. The problem of how to get replicated but I kind of think that might be a step too far. Better to think of problems as conflict between ideas. And what has ideas? Again people. Genes don't really have ideas. Butterflies, birds and badgers don't have ideas in my perspective on all of this stuff. They have instincts. Other animals have instincts but that's different. Let's not get into that right now and just stick with why are problems inevitable. So problems are inevitable because of the existence of people and people have this special relationship with the universe. We are a perspective on the universe. We are a perspective on the universe. We are a perspective on the universe. Each of us have our own perspective on the universe and in particular a perspective on

### 4m

time. We know things change in this universe from our perspective. From the perspective that we occupy we observe the change over time. Now from a God's eye view if you could get outside of the multiverse or if you could just if you or if you just think in terms of the Everettian multiverse perspective what happens in a sense in fact whether you're or not you endorse the Everettian multiverse or not what happens in what happens happens by virtue of the laws of physics mandating what goes on. Things are determined but that's kind of irrelevant to this particular issue because again we're worried about why problems should be inevitable but there's no what I'm saying there is there's no universal problem. It's not like from a God's eye perspective you look down and you go ah there are the problems. Things are just kind of happening or are they because people are making choices as well. So we don't really know the connection between consciousness creativity and determinism. I have my perspective

### 5m

on all of that. However from what we do know our best explanation at the moment is that we people in the universe are conscious and our conscious experience of the universe means that we are located. We're located at a particular place at a particular time and change happens. The past does not resemble the future. We're located at a particular place at a particular time and change happens. The past does not resemble the future. And so we're constantly encountering the unknown, the stuff that we don't understand which is problematic. It can be a bad problem that might cause us suffering that might cause us a threat to our survival in some way. But just in general it causes conflicts between our ideas. We observe something that doesn't fit with what we already know and so the entities that have problems. People are conscious beings located at the present moment.

### 6m

The present moment separates the past from the future, and the future is almost entirely unknown. The past is also unknown, and so it can be problematic as well. But the fact is, we're in this universe of unknowns. Time is the thing that distinguishes between states that have been known in the past, and states that cannot possibly be known until we encounter them, bringing with them problems. And so the universe is in a state of flux, and all of that together is why problems are inevitable. So I hope that answers Arjun's question. Now, moving on, reading Jitten. Jitten's asked a question on Twitter as well. Jitten Terricola. There are differences between men and women. They have different propensities for doing things. They have different propensities for doing things. They have different propensities for doing things. They have different propensities for doing things. They have different propensities for doing things, writes Jitten. What explains this, when we're all universal explainers, each capable of doing what any other person can do? Well, excuse me while I have a little drink

### 7m

of my tea. Okay, yeah, this is, I get a sense that people on Twitter, now and again, seem to imply that what I kind of put out there, in terms of my perspectives on this, would suggest that there shouldn't be differences between men and women. That once you go down this path of, well, all human beings are universal explainers, so we are fundamentally the same in that respect. Why aren't we the same then? In particular, why are there these systematic differences between the genders? You know, weigh in on all of this stuff about gender, Brett, go on. All right. Well, here's what I would say about it. The sensation of testosterone and testicles is different to the sensation of progesterone, estrogen, and ovaries, among other things. So those physical things, the chemicals, the hormones, and the physical structures of the

### 8m

body, do indeed serve as sources of problems, ideas, sensations. So it is unsurprising that we, males versus females, do develop some differences, different tendencies, different propensities. That's one thing. Certainly, the different hormones, the different physical structures of the body can manifest themselves as different behaviors, even as early as in utero, and immediately after birth as well. Or parents who have a daughter and a son can tell you the difference. They tend to act differently. And teachers can tell you this as well. Anyone who encounters, you know, lots of little boys and lots of little girls can tell you there is a difference between them in terms of their behavior that seems to come from their genetics.

### 9m

Now, I'm not saying it's determined by genetics. I'm saying that genetics has an influence on certain things, like certain hormones, certain chemicals, that then go on to provide different sensations, different feelings, different ways of observing stuff in the world, coloring the observations in the world. And so, you know, there's a lot of different things that can happen in the world. Now, it's not to say that those, that coloring, so to speak, can't be error-corrected so that people can converge on the same truth. It's not to say any of that. Of course, we can, and we're universal. We can come to understand the same truths and the same knowledge about the universe. That's what the universality is about. But early on, very early on in life, the mere presence of the different ways in which males and females develop, means very early on, and soon after their birth, they're treated by everyone around them, not just their parents, but by everyone else, slightly differently. And this has ongoing

### 10m

consequences for their behavior. And their behavior is determined by the ideas they take on, their memes. And so they end up developing systematically slightly different meme plexes, sets of ideas that control their behavior, determine their behavior. So little boys and little girls, have different hormones, have different physical structures. These physical structures and these hormones determine subtly slightly different behaviors, which go on to determine slightly different ways in which the adults and other children around them treat them, and simply by virtue of the fact knowing that they are boys and girls. But even if they didn't know they were a boy or a girl, the boy and the girl, boy versus the girl, acts differently in the world, and so are treated differently in the world, and therefore go on to have reinforced behavior that is different, and so are treated differently in the world, and so are treated differently in the world, and therefore are treated differently in the world, as well. And so you get this sort of ratcheting up effect of differences between the genders, differences between the sexes. I am

### 11m

deliberately conflating those two words. Now they're both universal explainers, of course. But okay, let's imagine them, let's imagine a thought experiment, okay? Perhaps the first ever, some early AGI that are created. Here's my thought experiment for you. We take this newly generated artificial, general intelligence and we put them in identical robot bodies okay you can imagine these robot bodies as sophisticated as you like human looking as you like but outwardly perfectly identical robot bodies in some way shape or form now what we do is we're going to raise these this would be an unethical experiment by the way but but imagine you raise them in two different houses two different two separated homes one is raised in a rather solid dark sharply edged place with large windows and no mirrors the interior of that particular home is huge but the outside yard

### 12m

is really small and this is where the first AGI grows up or at least spends perhaps one year of its early life in this particular environment now the other is raised in a softer filled with cushions and bright but with curved surfaces everywhere instead of sharp edges and small windows and lots of mirrors the interior of this home is small but outside the yard is large and this is where they spend their first year or so of development from let's say conception through to when they take their first tentative steps outside into the world beyond now both of these two AGI are

### 13m

in a relatively limited starting point so to speak diverge in some ways and those raised in the sharp edged dark but outward looking place with a small yard tend to systematically would tend to systematically resemble if you let's say you repeated the experiment over time you did this again and again and again with different cohorts of of people of artificial general intelligences then you would expect the ones that are raised in that dark sharp edged place but Which was able to see outside into a rather small yard to systematically resemble those ones that are raised in a similar environment just like that and the ones and I would be different to in systematic wise than similar ways to the ones

### 14m

raised in the curved surface bright but inward looking place with lots of mirrors but it has a larger yard now how exactly will they differ I don't know I don't know but I can predict they will behave differently over because of the ways what they're able to observe the kind of conjectures that they will have about sharp versus curved surfaces are small windows versus large windows the absence or presence of mirrors big yards and small yards dark versus bright internal lighting that all that sort of stuff is going to have some impact now using that merely as an analogy an analogy to well what's it like to have testosterone for the first well throughout your entire life versus having a predominance of cycles of estrogen and progesterone throughout your entire life what's the difference there what does it do it does something it provides some input into one's mind and and

### 15m

all we need to do is to observe what happens out there in reality that there are these differences between males and females and i i cannot say that it's due entirely utterly entirely entirely entirely entirely entirely entirely entirely entirely entirely entirely entirely too just the way in which they're socialized that's not the case because we know as a matter of biology there are physical differences between the sexes and those physical differences not only cause social reactions from other people but cause an internal subjective experience which is different between the sexes as well a systematic difference that is similar between the sexes between members of the same sex now can boys and girls learn to do exactly the opposite can a boy learn to behave like a girl and can a girl learn to behave like a boy and what is this behaving like a boy and behaving like a girl well precisely what it is in different cultures different cultures have slightly different ways of boys and girls behaving

### 16m

modulo all of those differences there are differences right there are differences every culture throughout history has been able to recognize that there are these differences between the sexes not merely physically but behaviorally and as i keep using this word systematically in other words reliably you can tell the differences and list the features of the ways in which boys behave versus the ways in which girls behave i know it might be politically incorrect but people can do it children can do it what are the typical characteristics of a boy doesn't mean that all boys will have these characteristics what are the typical characteristics of the girl not meaning that all girls will share these characteristics and there will be a lot of overlap okay lots more people have written and commented on this stuff some people make entire careers on this sort of stuff talking about this sort of stuff i don't find that hugely interesting except where it comes to bear on this kind of thing because where it crosses over to this concept of universal explainer is that yes in theory a boy could learn to behave exactly like a girl and a

### 17m

girl could learn to behave exactly like a boy there is this capacity for us to do so now it's not always easy and some boys do tend to act do tend to have more feminine traits and some girls do have tend to have more masculine traits and some girls do tend to have more masculine traits and some girls great that's just more grist for the mill for the case i'm making that we are universal explainers but just because we're universal explainer doesn't mean we should all be the same in fact precisely the opposite it means that we should all be different okay universal explainer means that you have a spectrum of different possibilities before you all of which you could take on but you don't because you can't because you can only possibly take on a particular personality modulo the people who say you're not a person you're not a person you're not a person you're not a person okay they have multiple personalities and all that sort of stuff okay that aside the fact is we are universal explainers of a kind instantiated in biology which provides us with certain sensations

### 18m

and certain tendencies certain propensities as we say but that is just to say we are biological organisms with these tendencies due to different physical structures that the sexes have but we're not fundamentally biological organisms which is where i disagree with evolutionary psychologists and so on fundamentally we are minds and there is not a feminine mind and a masculine mind there's just minds minds are universal explainers individual members of the class of universal explainers can be grouped in different ways they could be grouped as males and females okay but there will be differences you won't be able to pick one person randomly and say well here is what one must do to qualify as being a male member of the species because of these features of the mind that's not what we're saying here at all a mind as a mind as a mind in terms of its capacity to create knowledge to explain stuff

### 19m

to take interest in things to make choices out in the world and all of those features that make a mind a mind and different to what any other living system that hitherto we know about now the interesting is of course with respect to this question when we get artificial general intelligence presumably it won't be based in biology maybe it will be but assuming it's not assuming it's programmed in a computer in some way then it won't have this testosterone progesterone thing i'm saying it presumably won't have testicles versus ovaries presumably it won't have a particular male type or female type body but it will one would hope have a body of some kind will determine the kind of sensations that it tends to experience and if you manufacture isn't the right word here but but if artificial general intelligence tends to be created with a certain kind of body you could imagine a situation where there are two different kinds of bodies

### 20m

that artificial general intelligences could be instantiated in and those two different kinds of bodies would over time produce subtly different personalities or perhaps markedly different personalities between the two populations even though there would be a whole lot of overlap there would still be these systematic differences over time you can imagine giving an artificial intelligence wheels couldn't you or you know there's a kind of created with wheels and one created with legs there would be systematic differences over time the sensation of what it's like to um roll is going to be different to the sensation of walking and running okay again an analogy to the different sensation of having different parts of your anatomy if you're a boy versus a girl okay that's a long answer on that particular question next question is asked by david hearn now i should mention david is on twitter at david underscore hearn h-u-r-n well worth following if only for

### 21m

his likes he tends to like all this really interesting science stuff so i don't need to bother following all of these great science communicators and great scientists out there because david does it for me he tends to like these interesting tweets and the the output of all these great scientists and thinkers and so i just look at david's likes now and again and that's enough for me and he also has some uh great replies to people he's one of the the most subtle and humorous replies to um to lots of intellectual stuff on twitter as well so follow david hearn and he asks david asks with the right knowledge can we change the laws of physics or can we only get round them hashtag optimism okay so i've got a feeling knowing david from a distance knowing david from twitter this is a kind of tongue-in-cheek question almost he knows the answer that we can't get around the laws of physics we can't get around whatever the

### 22m

constraints are the limitations that physics places upon us now why is this well the laws of physics are just the laws that govern physical stuff and we are made of physical stuff so we can't possibly contravene the laws that govern everything including us and nor should we want to i mean the whole idea here is that the laws of physics prohibit certain stuff but in doing so they tell you what is possible what we're able to do the laws of physics themselves are not a problem not a problem they allow us to see what the problems are in other words the stuff that's possible but which we haven't yet been able to accomplish but we want to do so so no the right knowledge does not allow us to change the laws of physics no matter how powerful we get we cannot possibly change the laws of physics unless we could get out of physical reality in some way outside of the multiverse in some way i guess never say never who knows

### 23m

but you know like what's the law if you can't matter can't travel at the speed of light let alone beyond the speed of light is that a problem in a sense but it doesn't actually place a prohibition on you getting anywhere in the universe the interesting thing about relativity is as you approach the speed of light time dilates okay anything outside of you if you're the thing that's moving close to the speed of light all the clocks outside of you every single process outside of your frame of reference so to speak which is what they call it slows down slows down moving clocks tick slowly and then with general relativity it gets more complicated still when i say moving clocks tick slowly if if you're moving you would think your clock is moving but in your frame of reference if here i am in my room here if this room was suddenly accelerated to you know near

### 24m

the speed of light nothing would appear to be unusual to me apart from the forces required to accelerate me to near the speed of light but the wristwatch that i might be wearing or the clock normally but if i look out the window at any clock that is zipping by well the whole concept of relativity is is it me that if i'm moving at constant velocity is it me that's moving or is it the outside that's moving these two situations are equivalent if i look outside then what i see is every physical process every ticking clock ticking more slowly every physical process moving more slowly and then when you slow down you accelerate stuff weird weird stuff happens as well what am i getting at here what's this got to do with changing laws so if you wanted to you might say well what if we wanted to travel to the nearest large spiral galaxy to us or near a spiral galaxy to us it's the andromeda galaxy the andromeda galaxy is 2.2 million light years away and we've just said well you can't travel at

### 25m

the speed of light if you're something made of matter is this this particular law this this being unable to travel at the speed of light if you're made of matter which is what human beings would be made of presumably as well well even if you could remove somehow the mass if you could remove the mass from matter so that you were weightless then you could travel at the speed of light but there's no getting beyond the speed of light so far as we know so let's say that's a physical law is this a problem for getting to somewhere like the andromeda galaxy if that's where you want to get to and well perhaps surprisingly to some people the answer is no you might say well hold on if the andromeda galaxy is 2.2 million light years away if you're traveling at the speed of light surely it takes you 2.2 million years to get there ah yes and no if you're an observer here on earth

### 26m

watching the spaceship travel to the andromeda galaxy then yes if that spaceship was traveling at the speed of light remembering that car but let's say it's it's traveling at the there's a slight fraction below the speed of light via some mechanism known in the distant future also got problems there of accelerating such a mass to it's a very close to the speed of light you need a lot of energy in order to get that mass and as because as the as that mass of the rocket and the person the passengers on the rocket as it gets closer and closer to the speed of light that the mass dilates the thing that gains it's harder and harder to accelerate the thing closer and closer to the speed of light requiring more and more energy the energy quickly exceeds all the energy that is available in the galaxy okay you can do these calculations that aside let's say that we can travel through space at the speed of light we've we've covered that somehow or other by removing the mass from matter doesn't it take 2.2 million years to get there and a human being doesn't live for 2.2 million years and wouldn't it be a boring journey

### 27m

anyway if you're going all the way from here to there and it's going to take you 2.2 million years well if again if you're here on earth then according to observers on the earth who are stationary they will measure it that it takes 2.2 million years to get there and if you're on earth then it takes 2.2 million years but for you on the spaceship that is traveling at the speed of light you can get there instantly photons get everywhere instantly now if this has just freaked you out then i just encourage you to do a little research into relativity theory the faster you go the more lengths contract and and and at the limit when you get to the speed of light lengths contract to zero and so because of that a photon that leaves here on earth is and travels to the andromeda galaxy gets there instantly in its frame of reference it experiences no time passing okay photons experience no time passing i know mind-bending and let's say you're just traveling ever so slightly slower than the speed of light then you won't get there instantly

### 28m

but you'll get there very very quickly arbitrarily quickly in fact you know if you you there is such a velocity that if you left the earth and wanted to get to the andromeda galaxy 2.2 million light years away then you would get there very very quickly and if you left the earth and wanted to it would only take you 10 years or one year or 10 minutes or one minute and for photons as i say instantly so that law of physics that which places a prohibition on velocity okay you can't exceed the speed of light and you can't even get to the speed of light if you're got mass is not a problem for actually traveling anywhere in the universe because relativity allows for you to get there in the universe however of course if you want to come back again then yeah you're going to find everyone that you loved and cared about and all of civilization here on earth gone okay because if you went all the way there and turned around and immediately came back

### 29m

traveling at the speed of light then 2.2 million years to get there 2.2 million years to get back 4.4 million years would have passed who knows what for you it wouldn't have for you it's almost instant right you almost get there and back instantly but everyone on the earth has a the earth has experienced 4.4 million years passing and so the earth will be very different that's a problem possibly for you but problems are parochial aren't they you know that's your problem okay you you have to make a choice at that point if this was a possibility for you what's more important being able to stay with the things and people you care about here on earth or travel all the way to the andromeda galaxy uh you can't have both unless you're taking everyone and everything you care about with you this will be a problem for interstellar travelers of the future speaking of you know there is that movie interstellar which which actually um touches on on this well worth seeing so thank you david for that that question that's a fun one next is from jeff coast bourbon at jc bourbon

### 30m

uh his question is he's written a bit on education does he have any updated thoughts so that's me i have written a bit on education you know that's where i sort of spent i guess most of my professional career for want of another word excuse me any updated thoughts not really i mean i guess the only thing i emphasize is incrementalism because i want to um win the argument so to speak that there's a poverty of the entire philosophy which and and tradition which causes us to send children to school i don't like it i think that um you know school is coercive school has a

### 31m

all of that stuff and i think the place should have the metaphorical bomb place under it and we can we can get we can do without it that said it's it's that is such a a minority view that there's almost no it's not that there's no point making it we should make the argument it's just that it gets very little traction even in people that are very closely allied with what might be regarded as the worldview that i tend to present on top cast let's take for example the objectivists the ayn rand objectivists they're very much about individual human rights of course okay the right to your own life the right to be in control of your life all that sort of stuff remarkably except when it comes to children to a large extent they there is still a strong tendency not universally okay there are exceptions in the objectivist community movement whatever you want to call it who would say well children deserve full human

### 32m

rights as well but i think that's still a minority view even among objectivists they think that well you know children still need to go off to school if only we could improve the schools then it would be even more worthwhile to send them you know perhaps if they all had to read atlas shrugged and the virtue of selfishness then it would be even better to send the children off to this institution even if it was coercive even if it was compulsory and so on and so forth which is obviously not my view okay even if school was an ideal place where ideal i say ideal where they were learning better stuff where everyone was sort of you know shown the joys the true joys of science and philosophy and karl popper and you know and the beginning of infinity was the standard text david deutsch would be having conniptions but let's say it was let's say it was something like that i still wouldn't you certainly wouldn't want it to be coercive

### 33m

i wouldn't want to send kids there at all i think kids should have the choice so i i haven't got any updated thoughts in respect of that i just have i guess uh more and more i'm emphasizing the incrementalism because i know that there are people within the orbit of our our um you know the the the the who are enthusiastic um um supporters of uh popperian epistemology david deutsch's worldview um these ideas about optimism they're enthusiastic supporters for all of that including the idea that we should somehow undermine the present system of schooling including all of its coercive aspects but if we want to make real progress towards that project i think within the foreseeable within perhaps our lifetimes

### 34m

then there has to be a recognition of the fact that the majority of people are already not with us that when they hear about this they think craziness they turn off and so therefore it has to be an incremental dismantling of the most coercive aspects and that is happening in some ways it's two steps forward and one step back corporal punishment is by and large it has by and large been eliminated from the system giving providing more choice in subjects has become a thing which is better okay you can't choose to leave the school in many many restrictions. Britain seems to be a shiny example I've learned about this, that in fact it's not required that you attend school, but it's required you still be educated at home in some way and the government is going to check. I of course think, I've written on this and I don't want to go back through the arguments, that children desperately want to learn. They're enthusiastic about learning.

### 35m

You can't stop a child from learning, but you can stunt their desire to learn as a teacher, as a parent, as an adult, by making it uninteresting, by making it boring, by turning children off. Children will actually naturally find mathematics and poetry and music and all of that stuff interesting. The fact that they don't means something that has gone wrong with the way in which it's been presented to them. That's the issue. I think a lot of people know this. Anyway, in a situation where this is going to happen in a coercive schooling system, providing more and more choice is the solution to that. Giving parents the capacity to choose schools, giving students the capacity to choose teachers and their mode of being taught at schools is absolutely a positive step. There are more and more schools taking this idea on, where the student does not have to do the

### 36m

basics. What are called the basics. They can choose to do other stuff. They find that children find that in doing other stuff, then they want to know the stuff they thought they weren't interested in. A kid who wants to just do robotics, but they're not actually interested in mathematics, soon learns that coding sometimes requires a certain amount of mathematics. They learn it. They learn as required. They have more fun by doing it because it's relevant. It's their problem situation of what they want to do. So having more choice at school is an incremental improvement on coercively forcing everyone to do exactly the same subjects all the time. Having the option of homeschooling increasingly, much better than forcing everyone to go to school. I think one of the great benefits of COVID is parents got to see, have a greater insight into what was being taught at school and realised just the absolute poverty of what

### 37m

goes on in classrooms sometimes. That's good. Standards should be higher. With respect to standards of teachers caring about their students. Because many teachers, many parents I think saw that some teachers, not all, but there are this not insignificant minority of teachers who were just turning it up, turning up and phoning it in. Bad. So that's an incremental improvement and one of the virtues of something like lockdown. Lockdown had that great virtue that suddenly everyone was being taught from home. Why not let that continue? Why not let that continue? I'll tell you what, that, I thought that really that would be a huge step towards more voluntary schooling. And let's face it, I think the reality is, and this is good, when you've got homeschooling of that kind en masse, where the entire nation or at least the entire state population of school students is at home.

### 38m

Going to school, they're not. Number one, most of the official schoolwork can get done not in six hours or seven hours, whatever the usual school day is, but in two or three hours. Okay. I heard this from lots of people that the kids were getting through the work much, much more quickly because the teachers weren't setting so much. Great. Okay. So that's a huge step in the right direction. And which leaves so much more time. But the kids for the rest of the day to do what they want and learn in particular, learn what they want. I know a lot of adults have this view of children that if they're not being given official lessons, then they're wasting their time, that they're wasting their time. I mean, learning stuff that the adults aren't interested in. Making TikToks, how terrible. Learning to use the most advanced technology to be creative, how terrible.

### 39m

So that's all been done. That's all been great. So updated thoughts. Yeah. Let's expand what happened during COVID and make it not about when pandemics happen. Let's have homeschooling all the time. That's an incremental change. And if it worked then, why can't it work now? Maybe the next generation, maybe the kids that went through COVID, maybe there'll be some who experienced that for what, some years? Perhaps a whole year of basically school from home. Maybe when they have children, there'll be a not insignificant minority, perhaps majority, who think that they learned better. Hopefully they remember. One of my articles on learning was about how people at school almost universally hate the experience. Even the ones who do really well,

### 40m

they know that they'd rather be doing something else almost every single day. Even the ones that turn up and do very well. I was one of these kids who turned up, I kind of enjoyed it, went to school and had a broadly positive experience. That said, I still loved the days when I was off sick or stayed at home or something else because, well, you were free. You were free to do what you wanted. And in my case, in many people's cases like this, you'd be able to do what you wanted. You'd be able to do what you wanted. You'd be able to do what you wanted. You'd be able to do what you wanted. You'd be able to do what you wanted. You'd be able to do what you wanted. You'd learn your own stuff. You wouldn't waste the day. You'd actually read and write and do fun stuff that improved you as a person, which is ostensibly what school is about anyway, but tends to fail it. So perhaps we've got to look forward to the next generation. If they can... What I was saying there, I just forgot. What I was saying there is that even those kids, the kids that have a good time at school,

### 41m

much less... the kids that had a a bad time at school they all come out of school and within one or two years they talk about how wonderful school is they forget they have these rose colored glasses about what school was like ironically it's often the kids that did worst at school who did terribly at it who had a horrible experience who when they have children really want their children to go to school and to do well at school it's like i didn't do well at school i hated it but hey if only you do what i didn't do and you know really try hard then your life will be better in some way not realizing that that's what exactly what their own parents were saying to them you know try really hard at school they didn't like it they didn't do well and and and and they regret not doing well what do you think is going to be the experience of your own child they're they're they're they're in all likelihood they're not going to enjoy

### 42m

the experience of their own child and they're not going to enjoy the experience of their own child experience either because that's just the nature of school it is basically a universal truth children like adults do not want to be forced coerced into doing something they don't want to do and it doesn't have to be this way i know that there's a again that's a ubiquitous idea that well life is just about having to do things you don't want to do no it's not no it's really not for anyone who wants more on this follow the great for anyone who wants more on this follow the great lully tannant who talks about um this whole idea of non-coercion there's a lot of people in this space now um you know my time is limited i i touch on this now and again but um clearly in order to flourish as a creative human being you can't be coerced it's it's it's antagonistic towards being the best person you can and this is precisely what we do to students to children early on in their lives school is serving the purpose of child care and it's serving the purpose

### 43m

of child care and it's serving the purpose of child care and it's serving the purpose of child care more or less in our society children are doing much of their most relevant learning outside of the classroom technology has been a game changer so they are learning to create and learn in ways that people of previous generations can barely grasp i think to really know what's going on and so the more that kids can be outside the classroom pursuing their own interests the more we'll have excited enthusiastic problem solvers of the future rather than people who um have been indoctrinated into not only certain kinds of lessons but lessons about lessons lessons about how learning should take place and how the next generation should be enculturated into a way of thinking which basically comes down to seeding your critical faculties to the authorities okay we could go on and on and on about this they all

### 44m

all i was asked was do i have any updated thoughts clearly not except if we're going to change the minds of people the majority of which who hold completely different views uh to the one i've just expressed there we need to do it incrementally softly slowly perhaps talk up the virtues of something like homeschooling and then once we get there we can look further and look further and look further and in the limit which it seems to me to be quite a long way off school has gone by the wayside and i'm not going to go on and on about this but i'm going to go on and on about this uh there's a system of learning in place where if you want to learn something then you employ the services of a wiser more knowledgeable person and they can tutor you in some way shape or form um without you ever being forced uh to to to to to go to lessons and be given answers to questions never asked uh okay moving on this is a question from

### 45m

i don't know why i found this so funny dingbatis sapiens at dingbat sapiens okay and the question is please ask him slash her i'm him please ask him what fallibilism means also are we a self-domesticated species and why does adam sandler have a career okay what does fallibilism mean fallibilism is the stance that we can be wrong and in my view it entails um realism because if you can be wrong that means there's something to be objectively wrong about fallibilism is the stance that error is everywhere and you as a person as a human being can always be in error no matter what it doesn't matter how certain you are of something because certainty is merely an emotion merely a feeling you have so it just means that error is everywhere

### 46m

and it it gives you a certain degree of modesty coupled with optimism modesty on the one hand that maybe someone else anyone else could have a better idea than you and optimism because if there's an error there are their errors are ubiquitous then you can correct those errors and make progress and things can get better but but essentially fallibilism is the stance that you could always be an error you could always be wrong that's it okay it's the the absolute opposite to dogmatism and many many people are if you're not a fallibilist you're a dogmatist in some way in some way shape or form you're dogmatic on some particular thing doesn't matter what it is um it's like you're either a dogmatist or you're not you can't be a little bit of a dogmatist yeah some people are dogmatic about many things some people are dogmatic about one thing it's kind of like um are you religious do you believe in god or not oh no i you know i don't believe in all the pantheon of hindu hindu gods or i don't believe in all the pantheon of

### 47m

don't believe in the pantheon of roman and greek gods i just believe in one of them well you're just as still just as religious so a dogmatic person is someone who is anti-fallibilist about at least one thing you know who has who says of one particular thing well i've got no doubts in this of on this okay that includes fallibilism by the way fallibilism is something we can be fallible about i can be mistaken about it now does that mean that i would regard fallibilism you could have a an erroneous understanding of what fallible can fallibilism be wrong yes can our understanding of fallibilism be wrong yes does that mean that therefore dogmatism must be true no it just means that our what we know fallibilism to be could be improved in the future and i expect that it would be okay but at present our best understanding of it is what i've just provided there that we can always be in error um but what it means to be in error we might gradually be in error but we can always be in error and we can always be in error and we can

### 48m

come to have a deeper understanding of what that is and look back and go ah that previous understanding of what fallibilism was has been superseded by something better also the second part of the question also are we a self-domesticated species i think so i guess you know we've taught ourselves how to survive we're the first such species i guess to do that we we have instincts as well but by and large the way in which we have survived here on earth domesticated ourselves and we have survived here on earth and we have survived here on earth has been through explanatory knowledge the one unique thing that separates us not the one unique thing but but the crucial thing that separates us from every other extant and extinct species on the planet why does adam sandler have a career okay um yeah i'm gonna take i know i know it's a tongue-in-cheek question but i'm actually gonna take it seriously um you know i talk on talk cast about epistemology and science and and and and and and and and and and and and and

### 49m

and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and don't talk about one thing i'm really interested in happens to be stand-up comedy i listen to lots of stand-up comedies and actually my favorite podcast apart from my own my favorite podcast is um conan o'brien's one conan o'brien needs a friend i love it i listen to you know sort of religiously listen to this one it's the guilty pleasure i suppose and he interviews lots of really interesting people uh and in the same way that joe rogan talks to lots of comedians

### 50m

mark maron talks to lots of comedians i really like hearing not only watching stand-up for the entertainment value but there's a real uh interesting parallel between the history of comedy and the way it's developed and what goes on in science that that that stand-up comedy seems to get better over time at least there are stand-up comedians today seem to be objectively better than what they were in the past what they're able to do the way they refine their acts and so on and so forth there are some worse comedians now there have been some worse turns recently um with woke comedy you know but i still listen to even some of that what's that got to do with anything here why does adam sandler have a career i say all that because i think adam sandler is a great stand-up comedian he's one of these very very rare people who you know started off as a stand-up comedian really wanted to get into stand-up comedy gradually got himself onto saturday night live

### 51m

which is like the the objective for so many american comedians is to try and get onto that television show and then from there not merely have a viable career in the movie and in the film industry but become really really successful so why does adam sandler have a career because he's a he's a comedic genius now you might not like it you might not like the fact that uh you might not like the style of comedy uh i do uh most of the famous comedians i'm hard pressed to think of a comedian i don't uh really like um but uh you know i mentioned conan o'brien conan o'brien on his podcast conan o'brien needs a friend actually interviews adam sandler and they they happen to be friends a lot of the time conan's interviewing people he doesn't really know but might have appeared on his talk show but conan o'brien i think stands above all other talk show hosts that have ever been on american television i think he's just objectively

### 52m

better than so many of the others not simply because he's funny although he is that but because he he avoids politics he manages to speak to to everyone i think that the letterman kind of did that as well to some extent but now of course well i mean it's just a car wreck as far as the the um that that talk show genre has gone i mean it's really unfortunate that unless unless you are from a particular side of politics then there's nothing for you and why these people need to keep hammering politics i don't know but i i've long since basically i still you know will watch the odd colbert clip let's say but really it's just it's kind of painful if i want politics i will go to the news i will go to a proper political commentator someone whose business it is

### 53m

you know who spent their lives sort of looking into this kind of stuff but i'm not really interested in politics in the first place but you know going to a talk show host for for being badgered about particular political opinions um is is annoying and that's not the only source of comedy which is why i like conan o'brien conan o'brien has a deep understanding of not only talk show history but comedy as well and you talk about the history of comedy um and i mentioned him because yeah his interview with sandler just reveals sort of the genius of sandler and how sandler is well respected by other comedians what it is he's been able to accomplish the the the courageous way in which adam sandler just behaves like an absolute goose i mean it's not easy to do what he did it's just like it's not easy for ricky gervais to do what he did and it's not easy for him to do what he did he does there's comedians and then there's other comedians there are you know have great respect

### 54m

for anyone who's willing to stand up on stage and do it but there are differences between comedians in the same way there are differences between scientists between the kind of risks they're willing to take career-wise and how they're really able to go to the foundations of what is either funny or what is happens to be true in science okay and and really sort of upset apple carts so to speak is a really interesting one because i followed his career all the way from the office and before the off before he started the office you know he had this radio show in uh the united kingdom on xfm which went on for a number of years that's where he really got his break where he really first started he and steven merchant before they had a podcast they were on radio and you can find these radio shows out there it's hundreds of hours worth of um ricky gervais and steven merchant and and their producer carl pilkington people will know him um is there is out there on the internet to download and i've listened to that a number of

### 55m

times it's hilarious i mean and then that evolved into a podcast he was one of the very many of us who do podcasting now can thank ricky gervais because he was one the one who really was first there producing podcasts very early on uh and he had some of the the funniest stuff i think ever now it is true that that the overwhelming majority of comedians come from the a particular side of politics and that that's fine i mean there are some comedians now increasingly that are from the other side of politics but as i say that some of the best comedians you kind of don't know it's like the best teachers you kind of don't know what their politics are right they don't mention it they allow you to form your own opinions i think ricky gervais is kind of like this even though you know he's sort of a left-leaning anti-human certain guys i've talked about my disagreements for ricky gervais before conan o'brien's the same kind of thing adam sandler as well you know you don't you don't

### 56m

get the impression that he that the comedy all has to be about how terrible trump is how terrible the republican party is how how stupid conservatives are and that kind of thing okay that can be part of comedy i don't mind but when it's the entire act almost or every single night it's the same theme gets boring okay so i think adam sandler has a career because he's a great stand-up comedian he's achieved what so many stand-up comedians really want to achieve which is to become a great actor as well most of them seem to want to get into to film as well and any i haven't seen many of these dramas but but um i've seen at least one and and he seems to be a very good dramatic actor as well there you go even though that was tongue-in-cheek i still provided an answer all right i'm up to kees man's handen kees man man's handen at kees man handen sorry for

### 57m

mispronouncing your name and the question is how would you guard against knowledge production that's potentially catastrophic to humanity for example the knowledge to create easy nukes a weapon of mass destruction that can be made by anyone with a high school diploma okay well actually i think well i i talked about this actually uh in the podcast that will come out with iona um but again not until october um i'm pretty sure yeah i touched on this anyway okay so so that question there i just want to emphasize kind of a a an aspect of it it says again just to repeat how would you guard against knowledge production that's potentially catastrophic to humanity for example i talked about this actually in the podcast that will come out with iona um humanity for example the knowledge to create easy nukes okay so this is very different to asking

### 58m

how would you guard against um easy nukes how would you guard against knowledge production that's potentially catastrophic is asking how would you guard against knowledge production there's no such thing as knowledge that potentially couldn't lead to a catastrophe that's the nature of knowledge that's the circumstance we are always in so therefore my answer is i would never guard against knowledge production the production of knowledge is inherently unpredictable the creation of knowledge is inherently unpredictable you don't know what the next bit of knowledge is that's going to be created by virtue of the definition of what created is okay coming you know into into being um um Without precedent so we can't know ahead of time

### 59m

because we can't predict how knowledge production is going to unfold over time and this is why prohibitions on certain kinds of research is absolutely a math model to the world view that i try to promote people intellectuals scientists are very kind various kinds entire podcasts are devoted to listing problems people have made careers out of this out of telling us about the risks of the ai apocalypse to come catastrophic climate change nuclear war the next pandemic nanotechnology getting out of control the large hadron collider producing a a um a black hole a singularity and consuming the world name your bit of technology and your bit of knowledge and you'll have an academic or an intellectual out there somewhere or other

### 1h 0m

telling you about how it's going to go wrong and some of them will even put probabilities on this they'll pluck them out of the air but they'll put probabilities on this sort of stuff and i'll use bayesian reasoning to try and um impress you with how precise they're being with these predictions i want to say that and what i said to iona i think i wanted to make a a separate podcast on this and i may yet do this is that those things are reasonable problems to list potential problems okay but i want to suggest that there is a master problem that subsumes all of these and makes all these other ones look like peanuts and that master problem is slow progress or the slowing of progress because that is the one problem that will guarantee the extinction of our species all of these other ones there is a risk associated with them but the risk is only made real once we have created the knowledge

### 1h 1m

that that thing can actually be done so once we have the knowledge to create super intelligent artificial intelligence okay i i don't know that that's a thing we will have the knowledge of how to constrain that super intelligent artificial intelligence as well by the way i'm i'm saying super intelligent artificial intelligence i'm not saying artificial general intelligence quite a different separate thing categorically different as i've said recently these two things should be regarded as the opposite of one another artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence artificial intelligence is that thing which must slavishly obey its program its programming it follows an algorithm artificial general intelligence is precisely the opposite it's the thing that must have the power to do that potential to disobey that's not what artificial intelligence does okay it's a computer it's a computer program it follows a computer program whatever the case um knowledge that is potentially

### 1h 2m

catastrophic has to be pursued it's the only way we can solve our problems because all knowledge can potentially lead to the catastrophe we want nuclear physics it would have been so much better if we had nuclear physics we would have been so much better if we had nuclear physics we would have been so much better if we had nuclear physics we would have been so much better if we had does it come with dangers of course it comes with the danger of nuclear weapons but by the time you have the capacity for a easy nuke let's say let's think about in the limit okay in the limit could it be possible well it will be is it physically possible because you can be such a thing as a universal constructor okay recent my most recent podcast immediately before this one touches on the universe and the universe and the universe and the universe and the universe and the universal constructor from constructor theory the universal constructor can construct anything that's physically constructible now one of those things would be a homemade nuclear weapon

### 1h 3m

if everyone in the future has a a a universal constructor you know the generalization of a 3d printer so that you so long as you've got the program you enter the program into the universal constructor and it's going to build the thing for you one such program would be a universal constructor a program for a nuclear weapon okay there you go worried i'm not worried why because once you have the capacity to do that to create that thing you also have the capacity to undo the problem that would be caused by that thing in time what do i mean by that well i can imagine a scenario innocent in a world where people have the capacity to 3d print their own homemade nuclear weapon we're in the far distant future in a realm of kind of not science fiction but just of of a distant future we can only begin to guess at well let me begin to only guess at it as well

### 1h 4m

in this future we also have a situation where light speed signals detect the creation of critical masses of fissile material like uranium and plutonium that once that certain amount of stuff is created uh in the future we can only begin to guess at it as well and that's where we can only begin to guess at it as well and that's where we can only begin to guess at it as well in a city somewhere an alarm goes off in an office somewhere immediately and immediately at light speed nanobots react and deconstruct the thing using the same 3d printer or something like that once you've got the knowledge of how to create the problem the knowledge of how to generate the solution also comes along with that in almost all cases and that's where we start to see the problem and the key thing here is the reason why that is the case is because the good guys the guys that live in good guys good guys and girls whatever you want to say the people that occupy our

### 1h 5m

civilization a in a culture of criticism are the good guys we're the good people we're the ones that are making rapid progress so we're going to get there first and simply because of the fact we are the good guys and we get there first we're also looking for the good guys and we're going to get the good guys and we're also looking for the solutions to the potential problems that might arise from a misuse of this technology technology so i would never guard against knowledge production quite the opposite i would try increasingly to remove the barriers to knowledge production which is what we've got in place right now we're not as dynamic a society as we could be because of rules and regulations and laws and um even even political and moral ideas that tend to cause people not to pursue research into things that they otherwise would have if not if not for social and political pressure in a world where as the question says the knowledge to create equal easy nukes a weapon of mass destruction that can be made by anyone with a high school diploma in that world where

### 1h 6m

that's going on anyone with a college diploma has even greater technology that can undo that particular issue i can imagine all sorts of things whatever it is whatever the technology is that allows you to do that is going to exist in lockstep with a technology that undoes it you could imagine you know someone with this high school diploma has made this bomb and then try and set it off you know in in you know in in their basement or something like that that again at light speed something or other happens to prevent the thing from going off we're we're again we're in we're in a world where we're in a world where we're in a world where we're in a world where a strange world of of pessimism here but for whatever problem uh there is a solution but the one problem that is guaranteed guaranteed to lead to the end of civilization is the one that slows

### 1h 7m

progress problems that slow progress regulations and that kind of thing uh just a general attitude towards um progress technology knowledge production that is pessimistic is the biggest concern for civilization for for any dynamic society because what it does is it reduces the dynamism of that society causing it to tend in the direction of stasis and stasis is the guaranteed way of going extinct all other civilizations that have existed before ours are ceased to be have ceased to be because they could not solve their problem in time they were insufficiently dynamic some were near perfectly static some were quite dynamic but again didn't have the knowledge in time to solve the problems they needed to as david deutsch makes the point

### 1h 8m

if we want to be the one exception to this then we have to continue to rely on this one thing that we've got this capacity to explain the world around us to correct errors solve problems and we need to do that rapidly far more rapidly even than what we're doing it now rapid as it is it needs to go faster because people are dying literally dying and what i mean by that is we could have effective immortality we could certainly eradicate disease that will be done one day by our descendants it will be done one day by our descendants we will learn the cures for all disease we will have nano robots floating through our bloodstreams or whatever airing every single organ destroying every single virus and and bacteria allowing us to be effectively super people in eternal youth that's physically possible there's no law of physics preventing that from happen happening and in a world where it's physically possible and we want it it will one day happen we just have to create the knowledge somehow and any way in which you

### 1h 9m

guard against knowledge production is a way in which you're slowing that reality down so it's urgent it's urgent to increase the rate of progress it's urgent to eliminate barriers to creating progress it doesn't mean that it's a free-for-all and we recklessly go out doing anything enough people are making that argument enough people are making that it seems like as i say every intellectual that not only has it their own podcast but that goes on a podcast that has an interview that writes an article tells us about the problems and the reasons why we could should slow down progress what's wrong with people that arguments being made so i'm not interested in making that case everyone else has made that case even other supposed optimists make that case that there are dangers whoop-dee-doo we've heard it before everyone knows i want to make the case

### 1h 10m

that you need to embrace rapid progress far more rapid progress than what we have now rapid as it is virtuous as our civilization is it could be so much better so much better so i think we should try harder in particular we should try harder not to guard against knowledge production but to do precisely the opposite to to to engage in practices and policies rules and regulations which allow for individuals businesses corporations to flourish far more fully than they are far more fully than they are people who are scared and pessimistic and who want to live in a world where uh... under the precautionary principle where they're concerned about any particular the new invention creation discovery give them new zealand i don't know let them stay at home cloistered i don't mind

### 1h 11m

just let the rest of the great inventors creators thinkers scientists of the world get on with the project project of solving our problems faster producing knowledge faster it does come with hazards but the greatest has it the master problem as i like to say is slow progress next he's from dean of no acts so underscore irritable his question is what is scientific thinking scientific thinking isn't a special kind of thinking thinking is basically thinking what is rational thinking what is uh... wise of reasoning the science itself is distinguished by being a mechanism for correcting errors in our theories of physical world we distinguish science from all the other human intellectual endeavors by whether or not

### 1h 12m

the explanations can be tested on it anyone can engage in scientific thinking Everyone can be a scientist, as everyone can be a philosopher, an intellectual, a thinker, a writer, if you're interested. Now, so when it comes to scientific thinking, there are certain practices that people engage in when they go through the process of science. But the most important one is creativity, if you want to make progress. That means trying to identify errors in existing theories, which means going about and finding observations inconsistent with existing theories, so therefore you have a problem. Although people like to say, and I think I made this point in my last podcast, people tend to have this idea that, you know, many a beautiful theory is slain by an ugly fact. Well, it's not entirely true, okay, that idea.

### 1h 13m

Many a beautiful theory is made problematic by an ugly fact, okay, but it could be. It could be the case that sometimes the ugly fact is ugly by virtue of the fact it hasn't been a carefully controlled observation, let's say. That ugly fact might be just a poorly collected piece of data. So this is part of scientific thinking, being able to figure out whether or not, when you encounter these problems out there in the world in science, whether or not the problem you're encountering indicates a true problem with the theory that you have or with the method by which, you've made the observation. This is sometimes known as the Juhem-Quine thesis. So I'm not going to give a trope list of responses to a question like that, to what is scientific thinking like. Scientific thinking is the ability to collect data very carefully and to repeat your experiment and to ensure that your conclusion follows validly

### 1h 14m

from the method that you're controlling your variables and ensuring you have one independent variable and one dependent variable. Okay. All of that stuff can be learned by looking up a textbook on high school science. What I would say is genuine scientific thinking is having a critical attitude towards science. Not so critical that you think that existing scientific theories are flawed because you've found the new next replacement of relativity theory and you say, I've proved Einstein wrong because I've got a theory of magnetism which shows how you can travel beyond the speed of light. You might be right. But in general, there is a reason why I have this word crank. Cranks are sometimes important because sometimes they turn out to be correct. But the true issue with cranks, which is a person who tends to have deep misconceptions about existing theories and therefore thinks that an already refuted idea in physics

### 1h 15m

that usually occurs with an already refuted idea from classical physics, is in fact true and is able to overturn something in general relativity or quantum theory. This is where scientific cranks within the area of physics tend to come in. Someone thinks that they've got a mathematical proof of why relativity theory is incorrect. Despite decades of experimental testing testifying to the fact, that classical physics is no longer tenable. Classical physics of the kind of Newton. Newtonian mechanics is no longer tenable because it fails to account for observations like, simple example, what's going on in the Large Hadron Collider. That's what a crank is. Someone who is unable to distinguish between how evidence distinguishes between theories

### 1h 16m

already guessed how to use evidence has to be a scientist. They've got to be a scientist. They've got to be a scientist. They've got to be a scientist. They've got to be a scientist. It may not be a good scientific thinker. It may not be employing good scientific thinking. So that's another part of scientific thinking. Scientific thinking is about certainly being creative, being able to think about why... This is very hard. This part is very hard. Being able to look at existing scientific theories and thinking about where there might possibly be errors, how to identify those errors, and then, here's the really hard part, coming up with something objectively better. This is such a rare thing. This is why a scientific thinker like Albert Einstein is rightly lauded as being the genius that he is. Because prior to him, there wasn't really anyone else quite at the same level able to look at something like centuries of apparent, apparent experimental evidence

### 1h 17m

testifying to the correctness of Newton. And Albert Einstein coming along, going, well, you know, there's these problems here. Let me completely, from the ground up, from the foundations of physics, show you a new way, a better way, which explains why Newton appeared to be right, but where he's wrong, and why. And here's my new theory. That's scientific thinking, par excellence. And it's a rare thing because it's hard because you really need to be passionately interested and curious and focused. You know, you're day after day after day after day, day after day, on nothing but those problems. I can't do it. Okay, I love physics, but not that much. Einstein would just think and think and think. You know, read Feynman's account of his own life and what he did, how he went about thinking. It's just day after day after day of thinking of these particular problems. Most of us don't have that. Most of us don't have,

### 1h 18m

we have our interests, okay? I have my interest in, you know, a lot of people I understand would not. Not have the same kind of interest in reading and rereading David Deutsch's books and Karl Popper's books, okay? It's a personality trait. So too with Einstein focusing on physics. I'm not comparing myself to Einstein. I'm just saying that scientific thinking of that kind is a rarity. As rare as any other quirky kind of thing that people tend to devote their time with. And I say that because it's not a matter of, of intelligence. It's a matter of interest. Einstein said this, words to this effect. Feynman said words to this effect. You know, they didn't regard themselves as being super intelligent, particularly more intelligent than other people around them. Just that they were passionately curious about certain things, really interested in certain things.

### 1h 19m

All of that said, I think there are ways to improve your own thinking. There are common errors, common errors arising from misunderstanding how knowledge is generated and created and assessed, evaluated, that kind of thing. This is why I think if you're going to learn, if you want to learn any, if you're interested in this worldview and you're interested in being a scientific thinker, then I think you could do worse than read Popper and Deutsch and their ways of going about understanding how science works. Once you understand how science works, then of course you can be a better scientific thinker. Okay. Next question. From an Alan Curtis. At Alan underscore Curtis. Why is there only one Monopoly's Commission? Is that like a joke? You know, they've got a monopoly on Monopoly's Commission. What's the Monopoly's Commission? Let me Google. Give me a second. I can guess what it is. I presume it's an American thing. Okay. I can't find, Monopoly's Commission,

### 1h 20m

Monopoly's Commission, an independent body. Okay. The German, the German government has a Monopoly's Commission. The UK government has a competition commission. And in Australia, we have something called the, the ACCC, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Okay. Yeah. Right. Okay. Well, I'm going to say the, the standard thing I say on these sort of things. Why is there only one Monopoly's Commission? Well, it's almost like a joke itself, isn't it? Well, they've got a monopoly on Monopoly's Commission. Should we have another one? So there's competition in the Monopoly's Commission. Why isn't there a competitor to the ACCC, the Australian Competition and Consumer thing? I think one's too many, obviously. I think one's too many. There's no such thing as a monopoly. I'm going to take your Ron Brooks line here and many others who've made this point before. There is no such thing as a monopoly until, except for government and when government gets involved in something.

### 1h 21m

It doesn't have to be that the, the, there is an actual competitor in the market to whatever widget you're selling or service you're providing. It's just that potentially there could be one and potentially there is no advantage in law that you have or that anyone has. But government sometimes intervenes in the market and gives advantages usually to big corporations, right? Making it harder for competitors to arise. So I think one monopolies commission is too many. I think government doesn't need to be involved in the market, broadly speaking. And broadly speaking, businesses will compete. So I think maybe this is a bit of a joke behind this particular question, of course, that there should be competition in monopolies commissions.

### 1h 22m

There should be competition in governments. Now, of course, I don't think there should be, again, emphasising again, I don't think there should be a government agency that deals with ensuring there aren't monopolies in the market because the only way to have a monopoly, a true monopoly in the market, is to have coercion and force being used in the market in some way, shape or form by a company. But in principle, that is never permitted. It's against the law to use coercion, force, in other words, violence. Businesses can't do it. Google cannot have a separate police force that can go out and force you to do this, that or the other. Apple can't. The Ford Motor Company can't, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Corporations can't use force on customers or potential customers. Only the government can. The government has a monopoly on force. Now, do I think that there should be competition in government? There is. That's what we call nations. You don't like your government. It's one of the virtues.

### 1h 23m

It's one of the virtues of the state system, right? States in Australia. States in Australia are basically the same. But I know in America, it's more virtuous in that sense that you don't like California, you don't like New York, go to Texas, go to Florida. I hear about this a lot. That's competition in the market to a certain extent on government. Now, of course, you've got federal government and you've got a bit of a problem. There's no competition there. Should there be? No, there shouldn't be. And the reason there shouldn't be is because you really do need a monopoly on violence, okay? I'm with Rand on that. I'm with Rand on this tradition of law, justice, police, instantiates a whole bunch of really important knowledge about how to keep a society stable under great change, under rapid progress. I think I tweeted about this today. Absolutely crucial that we want to protect the means of error correction, protect the means of generating knowledge really fast.

### 1h 24m

I'm all about trying to make more and more rapid progress. I don't think this can happen. I don't think rapid progress would happen if we eliminated governments. I think it would happen more quickly if we reduced government power so that it was simply about protecting the means of error correction, protecting the means of competition, protecting individual rights and the rights of corporations and so on and so forth. I think then we'd have more rapid progress. Yes, absolutely. But should we eliminate and become anarcho-capitalist? I can't see a path to that. In so far as there is a logical case to be made for that, the logical case seems to be, well, if everyone was using their reason and acting perfectly reasonable all the time, then we could do that. Even then, I'm not too sure. I mean, people as individuals have different preferences and their preferences will sometimes clash and there ultimately needs to be a way in which to resolve the conflict because, because, reason alone sometimes won't do the job.

### 1h 25m

Person A will be saying, I'm being perfectly reasonable. Person B will be saying, I'm being perfectly reasonable. There will still be a clash because of creativity, because reason is not itself understood perfectly. And so because of that, we need this independent arbiter, call it the government. And the government will make mistakes and whatever. Okay, fine. But it's the price of living in a world where you want rapid progress, because to eliminate the government, the government means we once again devolve into these competing either smaller communities or individuals themselves, where I think my logic seems to lead me to the place of violence, that in individuals absent the government, violence would increase, not decrease. Yes, the government is a violent institution. It is the one that has the monopoly on violence. It uses violence. Sometimes, immorally, that we've seen that throughout COVID.

### 1h 26m

I can agree with all of that. But I still think that rapid progress is best fostered by ideally tending in the direction of minimal government with a monopoly on violence. That I don't know what you call the curve, you know, but you know, where at one end you have a super authoritarian government and progress is slowed because the government is over, overly coercive. There's a sweet spot where the government has a monopoly on violence, but otherwise minimal impact on people's lives and in the market and so on and so forth. But then there's diminishing returns once you take away the government's ability to intervene in conflict between individuals and corporations and that kind of thing, to the point where if the government has gone altogether, you have an anarchic system where the strong men, as Rand would call them, the brutes rule the day. And then you have as bad a situation as violent and corrupt a situation where only the strongest are able to the strongest end up gaining authority anyway.

### 1h 27m

So I guess it's like a circle. The government disappears. What happens is the biggest, strongest gang then takes over and you've got an authoritarian regime once more anyway. So at either end, it's kind of a utopian idea. Okay. Communism one utopia. You know, if only the government took care of everything, we didn't have free markets and the government was just distributing everything so that they were, you know, you've got this utopia. In other words, government will solve every problem that presumes that government can do a perfectly erroneous in a perfectly capable job of allowing for rapid progress. He knows how to solve the mistakes. Rather than the individuals, even though individuals are the ones that do the thinking.

### 1h 28m

Similarly, I think that the, the argument that will, if you take away the government, then we'll all just be using our reason or we can have our own private security and whatever. So I think it ignores the fact that people are creative. We are born with different. We started, I started this AMA. We're talking about people are born with different propensities, grow up with different propensities. You can't enslave people to, have nonviolent tendencies. Some people will just make the error of being violent. Some people will make the error of wanting to be a dictator and in a world without a government that has long traditions of avoiding dictatorships, the dictator will arise in an anarchic situation. Gangs will fall. Violence will happen. And those people might very well say, well, all we are is a big private security company, but now you have to pay us protection. Money. Now, I don't know how absent the government I've read the literature from the anarchists on this point.

### 1h 29m

I just think they under estimate the power of tradition and the knowledge of how society maintains its stability while undergoing rapid progress has instantiated in its institutions that that it's just absolutely crucial that we don't know how to keep society stable. We don't know how civilization in the West and the Enlightenment has done what it's done to the degree of fidelity required that says we could do away with these institutions. Now, incrementally, should we undo the power of government? Absolutely. Okay. So I think we should all stay on the same side until then. This is one of the great problems I have with the objectivists to some extent, you know, the anarcho-capitalist to another extent. Someone like me, who's a Burkean tradition, whatever you want to call it, who says the institutions are important.

### 1h 30m

We need to have more minimal government. We're all heading in the same direction. Basically, we are a very small minority, I would say when the rest are either authoritarian type conservatives or left leaning socialist communists. And in either of those cases, they like big government. And that's the tendency that people are heading in right now. It seems, especially in the socialist direction. So forget about infighting between us to a large extent. It should all be on the same side to just say, let's incrementally take back, you know, some of this regulation stuff, taxation stuff and allow for more flourishing. And if the advantages are more flourishing are obvious, which they will be, then hopefully more regulations are removed, more taxation is removed, more flourishing follows. But at the moment that's not happening at all. I think one of the reasons is that, the herding of cats issue among people who believe in or endorse liberty,

### 1h 31m

who think liberty is the way to go is an issue. So many have internecine wars between themselves. You know, the anarcho-capitalists will be, I think I said this in a recent podcast as well. It's almost like, you know, there'll be an objectivist debating an anarcho-capitalist in a lecture theater somewhere. When the genuine fascists or communists bash the door in and take them both away to the gulag. So, you know, how about we all just stay on the same side, arguing for liberty and individual human rights and free markets and all that kind of thing until we have this rapid deregulation of the market and the decrease in taxation and so on and so forth, et cetera, et cetera. But good question. Tongue in cheek question from Alan. Curtis, I think I think is this my last question?

### 1h 32m

I think it should be anyway, because this has been going on for a long time. Last question. Resty T at resty ton 86 question is I know Deutsch describes his ideas as footnotes to popper, but didn't he make some improvements like good explanations are hard to vary or was that something popper expressed to? That's definitely a David Deutsch creation discovery. This idea that good explanations are hard to fairy good explanations. Explanation is central to poppers philosophy. Absolutely. It's actually central to the fabric of reality as well, but it's one thing that I kind of missed to some extent. You know, I didn't, I didn't realize, you know, in the work of popper in the early, earlier work of David Deutsch, that explanation is there as being key. And the reason why it became sort of more prominent after the beginning of finish because David actually explained what a good explanation was because people had been asking him what is a good explanation.

### 1h 33m

You know, can you define it once I once once we had this more refined understanding of what a good explanation is then we could say, you know, here's what a good explanation is. And this is why this is what we're seeking in all these domains. Science, philosophy, morality everywhere. We're seeking good explanation. That's how progress happens. They're the ideas that transform the world as a subtitle says to the beginning of infinity. So on the one hand, yes, popper talked about science as an explanation seeking exercise. The critics of popper really admit this, right? They think that popper is just about falsification. People who claim to be popper scholars, people who are critics of popper seem to focus on this falsification. Falsification. Falsification is just the very useful criterion which solved a particular problem of how do you separate?

### 1h 34m

How do you distinguish between science and stuff? That's not science. The stuff that's not science can still be very important. Morality, absolutely crucial philosophy, mathematics. These are all non-science doesn't make them unimportant. And popper certainly didn't think that he just said, well, look, you're all focused on trying to figure out how to verify as true or to be confident in scientific theories. What I'm telling you is that's not important. Uh, the input, the central centrally important thing is can you test this thing then as a scientific theory? Okay. Well, not, not entirely. Okay. It's a necessary but not sufficient condition for being a scientific theory. Okay. So let's get onto the idea. David describes his ideas as footnotes to popper. Did he make improvement? He did make improvements. Yeah, absolutely. He's made improvements. David is a very modest person, I would say. Um, and I think that's a, that's a great, that's a virtue. Some might not think it's a great virtue. I happen to people,

### 1h 35m

I don't think in general, people don't need to tout their own abilities and discoveries and not in general. Anyway, in fact, it can be a good method. Actually, it can be a good method of error correction to say perhaps quite honestly, look, this is not my original work. I'm standing on the shoulders of giants and so on and so forth. If you're wrong about that, others will see it. They will find out. And your legacy, you will last in spite of your modesty and will be a more robust legacy actually, because you will stand tall in the annals of history because you know, you kept saying throughout your life, oh, you know, I'm just doing my best, but it's just an incremental improvement on what's gone before it, rather than going out there and saying, Hey, I'm the next Einstein. If you talk yourself down when everyone around you is talking you up, well, you're all the larger for it, I would say, and your work tends to get noticed even more.

### 1h 36m

I think that's the main thing you brag and people will notice that immediately. If you don't talk about yourself, but instead focus on your work, people will notice that too, and you will achieve what it is you really want to achieve, or at least what you should actually want to achieve, which is mainly for your ideas to be tested and solved. And if you don't, you're going to be tested and solve problems and improve the world to improve the whole place. That's what you wanted that you didn't want the credit necessarily. You didn't want the fame fortune. You want to improve the world. The other stuff will come when the world gets improved. I think that's the attitude to have. So you did. So is David just footnotes on Papa? No, but he says he is. Is it being dishonest? No. I don't think he's being dishonest, but I think it's a virtue, even though the rest of us can disagree. The rest of us can absolutely disagree and say that David's wrong about that.

### 1h 37m

People sometimes ask me, what do you disagree with David Deutsch about? Perhaps that. David says he's just footnotes to Papa. I don't think he is. There's not much I disagree with David on, although I think David prefers tea bags. If he has a cup of tea, he'll have a tea bag of a certain kind. I prefer the leaves, not the tea bags. A tea bag is the poorer cousin of the loose leaf tea, I would say. So there's a disagreement with David Deutsch. But no, yeah, so he's not. He will say in many interviews, I think he said by now, footnotes to Papa, but yeah, objective improvements on Papa. And he has made a significant difference in spreading, what is called critical rationalism or a version of critical rationalism. I would just say actual epistemology.

### 1h 38m

Further than anyone I'm aware of, certainly anyone alive today, he's spread epistemology further. Actual ways of thinking that are more correct than all those other people out there promoting ways of thinking, ways of critically thinking, ways of being so-called rational and avoiding errors. Okay. Because David will say, you know, people are error prone. It's just part of being a person. Okay. Your natural state of things is being an error. So David's modesty is not false modesty. I think he honestly believes that it's footnotes to Papa. He's being modest. I think he's wrong. He's more than that. But there's a reason for being modest. I think there's a virtue in this because it just means that the work, the ideas stand for themselves. So we wouldn't want, I don't think it would do as well if he was out there

### 1h 39m

sort of saying basically, you know, I'm Papa 2.0. I'm the intellectual inheritor of Papa's legacy and taking it further, all that sort of stuff. I'm better than Papa, something like that. He never would, of course, and he shouldn't. And I personally shouldn't say that of David, that, you know, he's Papa 2.0 because of what I do in promoting the work. And I think he's right. The work, but others absolutely can make their own judgements about this. Ultimately, history will tell, I think. And history has already begun to tell that story. So yeah, footnotes to Papa. Well, if that's the case, people like to say, you know, every other philosopher is footnotes to Plato, don't they? Clearly not true. I mean, Papa is not a footnote to Plato, it's an objective improvement on, on Plato, correcting a lot of Plato's errors. But, you know, Popper may very well not have existed if not for Plato.

### 1h 40m

Someone had to make those first steps. It's all a woven web of guesses, and all these theories are misconceptions in one way, shape or form. We're moving from misconception to better misconception. And the best misconceptions that are out there right now, the most accurate ones, the ones that will allow you to make the most rapid progress, are the ones articulated by and in the work of David Deutsch. I think that's a lovely way to end it for now. So that's the Ask Me Anything episode. If you'd like to donate, please feel free to look me up on Google, Patreon, TopCast, and feel free to contribute.
