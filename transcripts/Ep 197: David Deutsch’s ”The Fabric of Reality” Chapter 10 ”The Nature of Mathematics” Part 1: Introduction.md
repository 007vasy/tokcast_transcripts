Welcome to TopCast and to Chapter 10 of the Fabric of Reality, The Nature of Mathematics. Today I'll be talking about an issue, a topic, a chapter that really I've mentioned as much as I've mentioned anything else on TopCast over these last few years. Throughout the beginning of Infinity, we discussed the nature of mathematics. I've done an episode on the mathematician's misconception, I've done many episodes on other philosophers and physicists' misconceptions about mathematics, and of course I've talked about David Deutsch's view of how mathematics, our knowledge thereof, arises out of his own discoveries in physics. So the strange thing is that I'm kind of doing so much in reverse today, because my mind was blown. It was completely changed by Chapter 10, about mathematics. The first time I began to think, hold on, this mathematics stuff that I've been told throughout school, high school, and then university,

### 1m

how mathematics stood apart, it was a realm of certainty, it was the one place where you could get to the truth, in fact turned out to be just as fallible a domain of knowledge as everything else. To say that this was surprising is a mistake. It's a massive understatement. Even though I'd read the previous nine chapters of The Fabric of Reality, I couldn't have predicted the content of Chapter 10. I wasn't smart enough, I suppose. But it didn't enter my mind that all that stuff about conjectural knowledge that had already come also applied to mathematics, until it was laid bare for me here in this chapter. And once again, as I talk about throughout the TopCast series, one of the most thrilling parts of the worldview of David Deutsch is the sense of vertigo you get when you first encounter it, and then rather often when you hear the man speak. Because your cherished assumptions about the world, when you think you're this erudite, educated, intellectual person

### 2m

who understands at least part of the nature of reality, then Deutsch hits you in the face over and again with how everything that you previously thought, in fact, is wrong. And this is no exception. This is a prime example. Pardon the pun. Of exactly this phenomenon. There were the two big occasions in the book that I've talked about before. The first was Chapter 2, Shadows, where the ground fell out from under me. That, in fact, hey, you could understand quantum theory. That was here in The Fabric of Reality. Also, again, when David Deutsch undermined solipsism for me and said, because hitherto I'd kind of bought into the idea, as many do who study philosophy and physics, that Descartes kind of got something right. Namely, that I think therefore I am is a certain or necessary truth each time you utter it. So it wasn't until earlier on in The Fabric of Reality that you read that there's an argument against this.

### 3m

Namely, that argument is that if you're the only thing that exists in the universe, you're a solipsist if you buy into this idea that you can be certain yourself that you exist and that's the only certainty you have and everything else. It could just be a dream. Well, you're still buying into relativism with some needless philosophical baggage because all you're saying is that the content of your mind, your dream, is just as complicated and complex and behaves in the same sort of autonomous way as regular realism does. It's just it can be investigated via the methods of science and philosophy and mathematics in the same way that regular realism can. So these were two moments of vertigo at least, but this stands equally as tall. This idea that everyone is brought up with, that mathematics is absolutely certain, you can't possibly question anything in mathematics.

### 4m

How could mathematics ever be wrong? Mathematics stands apart from everything else. Well, here we go. We're just going to apply fallibility to mathematics, but not just. And where does this come from anyway? Now, I think David Deutsch's spin on this adds something quite new. Via his own personal discovery of the theory of quantum computation, it brings physics into the picture, into the Popperian epistemological picture of fallibility that we have. Yes, you can get there about the nature of mathematics via Popper alone. Namely, mathematics is just conjectural. All knowledge is conjectural. All is a woven web of guesses. You can get there via Xenophanes two and a half thousand years ago. What does Deutsch add to this? Well, he adds a fundamental physical theory to the picture as well. After all, this is the man who first created the theory of quantum computation. Why does that matter? This is a universal theory that applies everywhere to all physical systems.

### 5m

It says that even your brain can be simulated by a quantum computer. Every single atom that's vibrating there could, in principle, be simulated by a quantum computer. What does this mean? It means that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the internal workings, the goings-on inside a quantum computer, and any physical process, including your brain. So therefore, whatever laws apply to the quantum computer also apply to what your brain does as well, because they are equivalent in terms of fundamental physics. The laws that apply to one govern both. Why does this matter? Why does this universality of computation, applying to the laws of physics, to all physical systems, have anything to do with the nature of mathematics? Well, because our understanding of mathematics, including the so-called intuitions of mathematicians,

### 6m

are what brains are doing. Mathematicians arrive at their theorems, their truths, their understanding of these pristine abstract objects, their understanding of those objects, mind you, via the use of a physical system governed by physical laws. Physical laws which mandate the uncertainty of the output of any physical system that is performing a computation, which includes stuff like what the brain is doing. The brain is performing a computation. Yes, you can get some physicists to say things, which I regard as somewhat nonsense. People like Martin Reyes, who is a world-renowned astrophysicist, cosmologist, highly respected. But will say things like, comprehension is not a computation. Well, that's just an assertion. There's no explanation behind that. After all, it contravenes, contradicts a known law of physics. That known law of physics is,

### 7m

all physical processes are computable. They amount to computations. They're in one-to-one correspondence with the goings-on of a quantum computer. That's provable. So, if it's the case, which it is, that the output of a quantum computer is subject to error, which it is, then so too is any physical process performing a computation. That includes what a brain does. So, anything that a mathematician thinks is going to be subject to error. And you might think, well, can't we just correct errors? Yes, you can, but that process itself is also subject to errors. But like any area of knowledge, whether it's mathematics or science, or history or whatever, the critical approach helps you to identify the errors and correct errors, but you can never be sure or certain. You can never reach this state objectively. You might think that you've got it subjectively. You might feel as if you're sure or certain or something like that. But that doesn't mean you've objectively

### 8m

reached the truth in physical reality. You can't get outside. Everything is a woven web of guesses. You can't get outside the laws of physics. And so, for that reason, what your brain does, the certainty that you feel, could always be a mistake. It could always have been a quantum fluctuation of some kind, giving you the illusion of certainty, the illusion of having found something true. It could give the illusion of everyone on planet Earth having the feeling that something is absolutely true when, in fact, it contains an error that none of us notice. Now, this can happen. The best explanation for this kind of thing is, of course, that people have just made a mistake. And have hitherto misunderstood something. But it could be the case. You can't rule out the possibility that there could be some sort of exceedingly unlikely small measure of universes and we happen to occupy one branch of the multiverse where we've just made the error over and over and over

### 9m

and over and over again. And we're in a history where we just think that we've arrived at absolute pristine certainty and truth when, in fact, it's not the truth. After all. Okay, so that's a bad explanation. But it's also something that can't be ruled out. Whatever the case, this does provide a physical substructure to what Karl Popper was saying in terms of philosophy. Namely, that error is everywhere. Misconceptions abound. We can never be sure. We can never be certain that we have arrived at the final ultimate truth. Because knowledge is conjectural. The only way in which we can reach external reality is via our minds which are encased inside the darkness of our skulls, working on brains, obeying the laws of physics. We have these imperfect channels which, sure, we can attempt to error correct and sometimes we do quite reliably error correct but we can never perfectly ensure that we are ever

### 10m

free of error. Indeed, progress depends upon there always being misconceptions and errors out there. In all of our knowledge, including mathematics, because it's by correcting those errors that we improve, we make progress. And so, error, from that perspective, is a good thing. The fact that it exists, the possibility of error, means the possibility of correcting errors which means the possibility of moving forward. If there wasn't an error somewhere, that would be a block to possible progress in that domain. And that's not a good thing. We want to make progress everywhere in all directions. Infinite in all directions. All the time. So this chapter of the fabric of reality, The Nature of Mathematics, was written before I think the arguments were even better refined by David himself later on, under the title of what he has come to call The Mathematician's Misconception. Famously now, in his Dirac Award

### 11m

Ceremony speech, he delivered an address or lecture titled The Mathematician's Misconception. The text of the speech is here on his website. I've done some podcasts about it. You can watch the lecture itself, which I highly recommend. And it talks about the contents of chapter 10, but in new ways. It approaches it in subtly different ways. It's also of course there in the beginning of infinity as well. In the reality of abstractions and peppered throughout much of the rest of the book as well. Ultimately, it just comes down to human beings are fallible. Fallible creatures. Our minds are performing computations. This is very difficult for some people to understand, I think, and to appreciate the full implications of. That what our minds are doing is computing stuff. Very few physicists, it seems to me, although they tend to agree

### 12m

with the basic underlying principle, don't seem to appreciate the implications thereof. Namely, the implication being that you can always be wrong, even about mathematics. This is why I've done so many podcasts, and in particular this one here, which focuses very heavily on the mathematician's misconception. As you hear people like Max Tegmark enunciate over and over again, although he understands physics very well, I don't think he understands the implications of the universality of computation and of quantum physics in particular. Although he understands quantum physics, the philosophical implications are very important. He illuminates for me what I tweeted out recently about how, you know, lots of people who do philosophy degrees, they will study formal logic, which is highly symbolic, it looks technically difficult, it looks like mathematics, but it's not quite mathematics. And certainly studying logic to a higher level of proficiency as one can do, even mathematical

### 13m

logic, doesn't give you any insight into, let's say, calculus. It doesn't even tell you anything about trigonometry. These things are separate areas of mathematics, if you like. One doesn't automatically translate into the other. You don't get the other by osmosis. In the same way, you can do an entire degree in pure mathematics and never have a good understanding of the laws of physics. You might be technically proficient in mathematics, but you just don't understand, you don't have an intuitive feel for the laws of physics. You don't know how to fix an engine, you don't understand what the standard model of particle physics is, you might not even understand what general relativity is, what the implications are, all that kind of stuff. And in the same way, in precisely the same way, you can be a theoretical physicist, technically proficient in solving your physics equations, in understanding the history of physics and be able to perform calculations using general relativity and quantum theory and maybe even string theory. But at no point do you study

### 14m

the fundamentals of epistemology, much less Popperian epistemology, the correct stuff, the right stuff, the good stuff. But a lot of physicists, although they understand the first two moves are invalid, namely, understanding logic doesn't mean you're going to understand mathematics more broadly and understanding mathematics quite broadly and deeply doesn't mean you're going to understand physics at all. They understand all that's true, but they don't seem to appreciate that exactly the same move is invalid when it comes to being a good physicist and understanding epistemology. Epistemology doesn't come along for the ride so to speak. It should and it would be nice if it did, but people just aren't taught epistemology and insofar as they are, they have a folk epistemology which is completely false. Even the philosophy departments don't teach this stuff. There's no one outside of the community of people who have coalesced around the work of David Deutsch and Karl Popper who really understand this stuff properly. Yes, I have to say it. That's just the

### 15m

way it is. The so-called critical rationalist school gets how knowledge grows is created and what knowledge is. And I would say unless you're reading the work of Chiara Marletto and David Deutsch, you don't have our best understanding of what knowledge is. You will have a completely misaligned view about knowledge. You will have a platonic type view. You will have the objectivist type view that you can get to certain knowledge and all this sort of incorrect stuff. Anyway, my point is here that often people go to physicists. When I say people I mean podcasters, you know, people like Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, any number of people will go to a physicist to try and understand how knowledge broadly works. They will ask them questions about philosophy and epistemology as if they have some deep insight about these things. But they don't. They're separate domains. It needs to be understood

### 16m

independently in its own terms. The epistemologist who is expert in, let's say, Popperian epistemology won't necessarily have any deep insights into general relativity. Although they might have some because if you are reading Karl Popper, Popper's work, he talks so much about general relativity, quantum theory, science broadly. And so therefore you will end up having some understanding of those areas because he's always drawing on examples or instances of where his epistemology applies in real life science. A rarity, a rarity in philosophy. You know, you don't get this in Ayn Rand, for example. She doesn't draw her examples from the history of science. She draws her examples from an abstract realm or from morality or from economics and finance and certain parts of history. But it's not grounded in science which is where I think philosophy is best applied because it's clean. It has nice, clean examples of how knowledge is

### 17m

generated and what knowledge is. And then you realize, ah, that's how it works in science. Therefore, that's how it works everywhere because basically we're all being scientists all the time. In trying to understand the world, our circumstance in the world. And of course, Popperian epistemology then goes on to explain how, well, the demarcation between science and non-science is via the criterion of testability but that's not a criterion of meaning and so on and so forth. All that kind of stuff comes in and so then you understand that science is this kind of separate thing. Okay. My point still is physicists in general don't understand this stuff. They don't understand how knowledge is created, what it is, and so they are liable to make the kinds of errors that Max Tegmark makes or Sabine Hossenfelder makes or Eric Weinstein makes and so on it goes. The list of physicists is well, as long as the list of physicists that you can name who think that mathematics has this special place in

### 18m

the pantheon of subjects that we can study, namely that it is a realm of perfection, of platonic ideals that we can have access to. David Deutsch brings to us a different vision of what the relationship between knowledge creation and people and mathematicians is to the stuff they're studying. To the stuff they're studying. These are separate things. Your understanding of the truths of mathematics and the truths of mathematics themselves and how to bridge that gap via this method of, as Karl Popper explains, conjecture and refutation. Forms of criticism. This is different to all those other philosophies that are out there about this kind of stuff. And it applies to logic and perception and all that stuff that Ayn Rand and the Objectivists get completely wrong when they get so much else right. Now it may seem like I'm picking on the Objectivists here

### 19m

and to some extent I suppose I am because they're emblematic of this particular error. The error that is described by the mathematicians misconception because I think the mathematicians misconception runs deeper than just mathematics. It's the very idea or mistake that the empiricists made as well. That there is this royal road to certain perfect truth. And the mathematicians still hold to that today. They still hold on to this notion that you can intuit your idea or perceive perfect truth in some way shape or form. You can get outside of what Xenophanes called all being a woven web of guesses. Once you take that truth seriously. This idea that we're conjecturing our way to knowledge. All is just this web of guesses that you can't see the truth perceive the truth and access the truth. The final truth. But instead all you can do is conjecture

### 20m

what you think could be the truth and create knowledge about that stuff. And by error correction over time guess that you might have found some truth some useful information something we call knowledge which has some of the errors corrected so we have a movement in the direction of more truth broadly speaking. But again that too is not guaranteed as David Deutsch spoke about in my conversation with him with Naval Ravikant. We talked precisely about how well you just can never know that what you're building in terms of this edifice of knowledge might itself contain all these terrible misconceptions. Maybe just maybe what you have is something more like a religion. But then again you know I might say something like well even religion is not in the whole completely false. It can contain a whole bunch of misconceptions and supernatural nonsense and so on and so forth but it might still be converging on certain truths

### 21m

that you can get independently via other routes that don't involve the superstitious nonsense let's say. But all of that aside. The objectivists like the empiricists like a whole bunch of other philosophers and philosophies claim that there is this way of reaching perfection in our knowledge in some way. That although they will admit and Ayn Rand actually does admit that we human beings are fallible that reason is fallible. That nonetheless there are certain moods in which you can be absolutely certain like a law of identity because they can't imagine how it would possibly be otherwise. They want to have a foundation. Everyone wants a foundation except for Karl Popper and David Deutsch. We talk about how you don't need a foundation. It doesn't require a foundation. You're constructing a web not a building. And there's a difference you know. The web is sort of all interconnected and it's able to

### 22m

capture reality to some extent if you're building a good web. But it's not like a building where you have the foundations at the bottom and if you find a floor with the foundations then the whole thing falls apart. The whole thing falls apart. No. What we say is well what you're calling foundations might very well shift and change but the whole thing, the whole structure doesn't have to fall apart. In the same way the web isn't going to completely collapse because a particular strand is broken at some point to torture these analogies perhaps a little too much. Okay. Almost enough treading water. We should get into some reading. Maybe one more thing to mention just before I go on. If you want to hear an excellent conversation about some of this if you're not let's say persuaded of the idea and I know many aren't. This idea that the human brain is a computer. It's performing computations and so therefore is subject to the laws of physics and so we can understand or have some deep insight about

### 23m

what the brain can do and can't do and what the nature of different kinds of knowledge is and ideas that we have explicit and inexplicit ideas let's say. This wonderful conversation on Luli Tannant's Reason is Fun podcast. It's this one here. They've had a number of conversations Luli and David and in this one in particular they talk precisely about this idea of the brain being a computer and Luli presses David over and again about this particular idea and the implications thereof. Everyone should listen to this conversation. You can hear Luli probing the truth. The truth that all physical processes can be simulated by a quantum computer and so all physical processes are subject to the same errors as what computers are and so the uncertainty is kind of built in at a fundamental level and so therefore in explicit ideas we can't get to them directly

### 24m

in the same way we can't get to any ideas directly. Everything is again this woven web of guesses and if you want to try and fix something about your mind let's say that too is always going to be error prone and it's understandable that people struggle with this but I put it on a par with this notion that the brain just is a computer of a kind of a special kind of course of a special kind but you can't get outside of the laws of physics it's that whole idea of you know if you have a new explanation a new theory of physics and let's say it disagrees with the law of the conservation of matter well no big deal because the law of conservation of matter isn't a law anyway it sort of applies in chemistry to some extent but we used to think it was a proper law that governed everything and then we figured out well there are these things called nuclear reactions which absolutely violate the law of conservation of matter so no problem your

### 25m

new theory of physics violates the law of conservation of matter no problem if your law of physics disagrees with let's say the first law of thermodynamics which is the conservation of energy law well okay you might need to rethink what's going on there but there's hope there is hope after all because there are certain quantum physical processes which might be able to get you out of your bind in terms of violating the law of conservation of energy or quantum cosmology or certain cosmological exotic cosmological theories which violate the law of conservation of energy let's say you know where does dark energy come from this kind of stuff so you know all hope is not lost if your new favored theory violates the law of conservation of energy although you should be very critical indeed skeptical but as people have often said if if your new theory violates the second law of thermodynamics then all hope is lost

### 26m

for you there is nothing we can say to save your new explanation it violates a deep fundamental truth about reality namely that the overall entropy of the universe must increase as time goes on and if you are saying your new theory violates that you've got all the work ahead of you I would say that this idea that all physical processes are computable and a special case is well what the human brain is doing is a computable function stands on the same level as the second law of thermodynamics or indeed something like neo darwinism you know this idea that genes are the unit of selection for evolution by natural selection which explains why we have a diversity of species all this sort of stuff that is a fundamental truth of biology and if your new theory of biology about birds or something

### 27m

violates that in some way well all hope is lost for you in your you know your ornithological theory or your theory of dinosaurs or whatever it happens to be if you try to step outside of that you've got problems all the work is still ahead of you so too if your favoured theory of how the mind works or of the brain or of psychology or something like that tries to say that the brain is not some kind of computer all hope is lost to you maybe not ok everything is fallible all knowledge is conjectural so yes the second law of thermodynamics could be wrong evolution by natural selection could be wrong the gene might not be the unit of selection not all physical processes might be computable maybe you've found a quantum gravity computer that challenges our present understanding but that's the whole point our present understanding is

### 28m

our best understanding at the moment it's our deepest understanding of how science works and reason is a concept applied to the universe and so we need to take our best deepest theories seriously it's not to say it's impossible for them to be wrong in fact quite the opposite we expect them to turn out wrong but in the meantime if you want to make progress take them seriously and when you're talking emergent stuff make sure the emergent stuff comports with what you understand the fundamental stuff to be about and there has to be a marrying of this and if there is a contradiction between these two things your emergent theory of psychology let's say and the deep truths that we understand of physics then so much for your theory of psychology now I don't think that Lully is making this error not by any stretch of the imagination but in certain moods you can hear people do object to this notion of the brain as a computer

### 29m

it's not dismissing there's nothing dismissive about that claim it's not saying well the brain is just a computer so therefore so much for qualia so much for consciousness so much for the deep insights that a deeper understanding of let's say memetics and psychology could bring to us no the richness of human experience is there the complexity of humanity and the way in which minds work is all still there it's just it's bounded within a substrate of physics and what we understand physics to be in the same way that human bodies obey human minds obey laws of physical computation okay but you know so what we're about to come to and I'll begin the reading now is the idea that your brain is a noisy quantum system like everything else in physical reality things can go wrong in completely unexpected ways

### 30m

there are always going to be errors you do not intend which are all to be expected this idea of unexpected errors is itself to be expected given quantum theory your mind cannot correct all the errors made by your brain as they are made in real time maybe later but those corrections are themselves as I said earlier similarly error prone so we're trapped as I say trapped might not be the right word but we are within this woven web of guesses or a woven web of quantum processes those are error prone and of course when you explain this I encounter this all the time with objectivists you explain all this stuff about how knowledge is conjectural and they say so you're a relativist then they completely misunderstand that no quite the opposite indeed not a relativist not a dogmatist a fallibilist

### 31m

says that there is something to be wrong about they walk the line between these two misconceptions about what knowledge is that knowledge isn't possible on the one hand the relativist or the skeptic's claim and on the other hand that you can possess the final certain truth the dogmatist's claim the fallibilist says the final ultimate truth it exists but you can't get there so it takes what is good about both things dogmatism and relativism of which there isn't much and corrects the errors in those things to produce the philosophy of fallible knowledge creators conjectural knowledge you know you sometimes do feel like Gandalf trapped by Saruman on the tower of Orthanc you know Gandalf would say as the great papyrian all is a woven web of guesses all conjectures are error prone

### 32m

and there is no way to escape this simple truth so you are a relativist then no Saruman misses the point he misses the point then the objectivist missed the point and other philosophers missed the point that just by admitting that knowledge claims can contain error doesn't mean that you think there's no possibility of knowledge you're not a relativist quite the opposite I've said it a number of times now so let's get to the reading clearly this is going to be an episode in a number of parts but of course as usual with these regular episodes of me commenting on discussing breaking down parts of the books of David Deutsch I won't be reading everything so I encourage everyone to buy the book if you don't already have it and read along with me

### 33m

and make sure you go to those parts where I skip over because reading the entire thing is absolutely essential for understanding completely what David Deutsch intends or at least your understanding of what David Deutsch intends more fully and David writes at the beginning of chapter 10 the nature of mathematics and the fabric of reality the fabric of reality that I have been describing so far has been the fabric of physical reality yet I have also referred freely to entities that are nowhere to be found in the physical world abstractions such as numbers and infinite sets of computer programs nor are the laws of physics themselves physical entities in the sense that rocks and planets are end quote this is a point that I make in my short podcast here the mathematicians misconception something I come back to in this podcast here

### 34m

where I break down mathematics as discussed by Max Tegmark and Sam Harris in my things that make you go hmm series if I can give a plug for that well worth listening to not just if you want to hear about what I regard as the errors that a typical physicist makes on these topics and a typical public intellectual podcaster makes on these topics but I also use it as a reason for explaining the alternative world view the world view that I'm coming from that David's coming from and Karl Popper is coming from and anyone else who is inculcated with these ideas is coming from as compared to what I call the mainstream academic intellectual perspective and on this topic there is a certain degree of alignment it's just how we transition between these

### 35m

two worlds so to speak I call it as Jaron Lanier would call it being a disciplined dualist David does not describe himself as a dualist in fact he says he doesn't really understand what precisely dualism means and I get that impulse you know does it mean there's two substances in the world well no but does it mean there are two kinds of things in the world I think it does and I think it is just the difference between software and hardware physical things and abstract things which is what David is saying here and that's why I say I identify dualism and when I say disciplined dualist in Jaron Lanier's sense it means you don't go saying much more than there are just these two things saying what these other abstract things are made of is the wrong question you can ask what physical stuff is made of, it's made of particles

### 36m

but to ask what are abstract things made of is the wrong question because they're not made of anything they're not a substance in that way it's also the wrong question to say things like well if physical things exist in the physical world where do abstract things exist well that's the wrong question it's asking for a time or a place in which to locate these things but that's the wrong question because they're not located in a physical space with a time and a place that you can have coordinates of that's not what abstract things are that's not what abstract existence is about it's not about the physical location of things anyway I go into that elsewhere so I won't recapitulate that entire argument here all of it is just to say there simply are two kinds of things that exist the stuff that's made of matter

### 37m

physical entities and stuff that isn't that's abstracted away from those physical things known as abstract things for example any individual cat that you can point to is a physical thing it's made of atoms but the concept of cats is not made of physical things it's an abstraction where you take all the instances of cats and abstract from that this thing called cat and you say that's an abstract thing so the category of cats is itself an abstract thing numbers are abstract things concepts like justice are abstract things I would call them ideals but we come to understand increasingly better over time but always

### 38m

imperfectly but there is this ideal a principle if you like that when we put into practice we imperfectly implement it and we can come to better understand it over time but it exists and it exists in better and better ways in the physical world but we're striving for something in the same way that with mathematics we're striving to understand numbers and we do that through physical symbols instantiations representations of those things that have independent existence then we get into really complicated kinds of abstractions things like software because software not only is an abstraction like number but unlike number it also has this property of running you have to take the program the software and rather than it just sitting there inertly on

### 39m

a hard drive or a CD ROM as we used to call it or a DVD or a solid state device of course these days where it's just sitting there not doing anything you can still call it software it's a piece of code or you could write it down on a piece of paper if you like as an algorithm it's not doing anything but when it runs well the software is running and it's doing stuff and so that's a different kind of abstraction that now has physical effects in the real world so that's a different sort of thing it's still an abstraction knowledge itself actually speaking it's a kind of abstraction that must be instantiated be represented in the world for it to exist you can't call something knowledge if it doesn't exist yet that's not knowledge it's not something that we know but numbers they really do exist even if we don't know about them yet

### 40m

as I like to say the next highest prime number yet to be discovered really exists it's out there because hey in a few days weeks months whenever it happens to be someone will find it they will discover it it was there waiting to be discovered at the moment you look up Wikipedia and you find the highest known prime number we can prove as a matter of rigorous mathematical proof as we like to say that there are infinite prime numbers they're all there where are they wrong question they just exist not in space not in time not in the physical universe but they do exist and we can come to find them bring them into the real world from where wrong question again they're not in another place they just exist disciplined dualists you can just say they exist we're going to understand this concept of how abstract things exist

### 41m

itself better over time we'll come to understand what these things mean when Jaron Lanier talks about this by the way what he's talking about is consciousness what is consciousness what is mind well it's a different kind of thing to what a brain is it's a different kind of thing to what usual matter is all we can say is that it's different to this other stuff that we use the laws of physics to explain hitherto mind you we just don't know how to incorporate consciousness fully or mind fully within our conception of physics yet we don't fully understand it but we're coming to so for now we just have to be disciplined in other words don't make crazy claims that you already understand consciousness you already have a theory of consciousness without us properly being able to write down the algorithm for it if you like but that must be possible as David Deutsch says it's a physical process it arises in minds we know that

### 42m

minds arise from brains we just don't know how consciousness arises who knows how exactly is it only in human minds I tend to think so but I can't prove that maybe it arises in lower life forms as well maybe dogs are conscious maybe apes are conscious maybe bacteria is conscious okay I think that's a little bit crazy to start going down the pan psychism route that's another story I'm getting away from things but let me just finish this point that knowledge is this weird thing that has to be instantiated numbers are a different kind of abstraction that don't have to be instantiated some of them are the ones that are unknown or have never yet to be instantiated an infinite number of numbers will never be instantiated but they still exist in other words we'll never possibly write down all the possible numbers that are out there you know if you want to talk infinite and different kinds of infinite well all the different kinds of infinite are out there in mathematics but because they're infinite

### 43m

but the universe has a finite number of ways in which the matter can be arranged it's simply physically impossible to instantiate all the numbers that's that mind is different again to all those other kinds of abstraction that I have mentioned so far David Deutsch talks about this in this question for David that I asked years ago now when I completed my series on the beginning of infinity one of the highlights highlights of I suppose my own life here full stop but also you know highlights of my podcast series was interviewing David getting to talk to him precisely about this and one of the questions I was keen to get his opinion on that he doesn't talk about much but of course he's willing to talk about anything when you ask him was this question about the nature of mind and he makes the point here well mind is different it's a different kind of abstraction again and basically what he says is well unlike all those other kinds including knowledge and including regular

### 44m

software it needs to be running it needs to be instantiated physically just like knowledge it needs to be running like software kind of needs to be running to be software rather than just code represented as hardware but also do does mind need to be running in a particular kind of physical substrate does it need to be running at a certain speed how fast these are questions yet to be answered after all if you were to take the algorithm for mind whatever that is when I say mind I mean a conscious creative thing like people are and you just wrote that code down as an algorithm on a piece of paper that wouldn't be a mind not yet it would be the recipe for a mind now let's say you put that into a regular computer and ran it really slowly would that be a mind

### 45m

then don't know maybe not maybe it won't work just as a simulation in a computer yet we don't know is there something about wetware I tend to think not because of the universality of computation but the question is still to some extent open to us we don't know the relationship between different ways of processing stuff is a neural network different to a regular kind of information processing is what a brain is doing different to a neural network I think the answer is yes and different again to regular computation as in the way in which non neural networks things like normal computers that are built upon machine code and running binary digits and all that sort of stuff using logic gates

### 46m

is it different again to that perhaps there's just so much to say here so many open questions so does mind need to be running the answer seems to be yes does it need to have a particular kind of physical substrate perhaps does it need to be running at a certain speed perhaps all these questions are open maybe they're all easily answered maybe it's just no no no it doesn't have to be running at a particular speed it doesn't need a particular physical substrate and mind just is like any other kind of physical program to that extent I don't know it will be an interesting day when we can refute all the claims that you do need a physical substrate and you do need a particular speed of runtime and all that sort of thing but I've certainly made the point there are two different kinds of things with existence in this universe purely physical stuff and things that are a bit more than just physical stuff

### 47m

okay so that was 15 minutes on less than a paragraph but let's persevere I think we'll get through just a few more paragraphs and we'll just treat this as a prelude to the chapter itself let's keep going David goes on to write quote as I have said Galileo's book of nature is only a metaphor and then there are the fictions of virtual reality the non-existent environments whose laws differ from the real laws of physics beyond those are what I've called the can't got you environments which cannot even be rendered in virtual reality I have said that there exist infinitely many of those for every environment that can be rendered but what does it mean to say that such environments exist if they do not exist in reality or even in virtual reality where do they exist end quote so just remember here Galileo's book of nature David says there is only a metaphor the idea that the book of nature is written in the

### 48m

language of mathematics there is no such book of nature you can't read you can't just look at nature open up the so-called book and just get from that book the knowledge to extract the knowledge that is the ancient misconception that implies a bucket theory of mind basically the facts are there just look at them and you'll extract the knowledge out this is the objectivist mistake right they think there's a book of nature they think you can just see reality perceive reality perceive the knowledge this is Ayn Rand's mistake this is the mistake of so many physicists that they really do think that knowledge is there fundamentally as mathematics in the physical world and it also leads to these misconceptions and Sam Harris talks about this and this is this ancient idea ancient now of the

### 49m

unusual effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences okay yes so it's true the natural sciences employ mathematics is it so unusual is it that much of a deep mystery after all I'm on the side of Feynman that it's kind of hitherto that we found that complex mathematics is very very useful in being a language that is able to describe parts of physical reality that seems to be no accident but okay is Feynman correct that ultimately what we'll find I say ultimately but is the next step in the evolution of our understanding of physics going to reveal not higher degrees of complexity which seems to have been the trend so far you know we go back to Galileo and it's basically an algebraic notion of physics and then we get to Newton

### 50m

who employed calculus far more complicated ways of describing motion then we get to quantum theory where you're employing very complicated forms of algebra matrix you know linear algebra type stuff or and or very complicated differential equations that go beyond anything that Newton was ever employing and then you get to of course string theory which is inventing new and even more complicated forms of mathematics in order to describe things that well we don't even know if they exist these strings it seems like the evolution is more and more complicated forms of mathematics which leads some down the road of pessimism people like Neil deGrasse Tyson Sean Carroll various other popularizers who basically kind of throw their hands up in the air and do say things like well maybe there will come a limit to how much we can understand because it seems like the mathematics

### 51m

is getting too complicated for us well maybe the mathematics is getting too complicated for them is all that we might say about that some mathematicians really love this game of developing more and more complex mathematics it's fun for them it's like art in the same way that that artists don't tend to say well maybe the next kind of art that we create is going to be too complicated for us to ever possibly appreciate we can't do it now well you can't do it I can't do it I'm not interested in trying to develop ever more wondrous kinds of high fidelity art it's just not my thing whether it's a form of visual art of the kind that you know AI is now producing that is even beyond the capacity to some extent of human artists to do or new versions of cinematography that go well beyond my skill and talent to

### 52m

ever replicate and most people's but some people are really into that kind of stuff that's great that's for them if you're really interested in these things you will develop new techniques or new kinds of apps let's say new kinds of code does anyone in the computing community say things do any coders say maybe the next kind of app the next generation of app is just going to be too complicated for us to ever possibly appreciate and ever possibly write there's a limit to how complicated apps can become no but in physics it seems to be you know it's just what people say about the laws of physics maybe the next generation of the laws of physics because of this gradual ratcheting up of the complexity of the mathematics used to describe physics and physical laws has been to get more complicated maybe the next set of laws will be just too complicated for us to understand well too complicated for them to understand

### 53m

because they get bored of it and I understand the impulse you know if you're not a mathematician which I'm not I'm more on the physics side of things and even then just the astrophysics side of things which well if you know anything about physics you'll know and appreciate that the mathematics that is used in astrophysics is not all that complicated even in quantum theory not all that complicated yet the general relativity a little bit more complicated okay it depends on how far you want to go into these things string theory very complicated you have to sort of sit down for a long time and sit with these things and devote years to trying to understand what's being said there and you get to a point as a physicist you kind of go ah what's the point it's not even real physics anyway like it's not connecting to the physical world via experiments and problems that arise and you know we can talk about that the point is mathematicians are not so pessimistic about the possibility of understanding this stuff but physicists are

### 54m

because they have an impulse of getting bored and I understand that but that's by the by as Feynman said there's no reason to presume that this is a necessary fact about reality that things must get more complicated it could be the case that we're evolving towards a simpler way of understanding physics mathematically namely that the rules of physics will turn out to be more like the rules of the checkerboard rather than complicated stuff like string theory and so I made a hypothesis often that the laws are going to turn out to be in the end simple like the checkerboard and that all the complexity is from size but that is of the same nature as the other speculations that other people make it says I like it you don't like it it's not good to be too prejudiced about this so if Feynman is correct and

### 55m

the laws of physics turn out to be more like this checkerboard stuff then well everyone will be able to understand super complex physics complex in the sense that the physics that comes after quantum theory and general relativity the unification of those two things might be really simple ultimately speaking complex in the sense that well it's beyond it's a step beyond what general relativity and quantum theory say about reality so it's an evolution beyond that but the rules are so simple that you know any primary school student will be able to understand it any person who's never really taken an interest in physics hitherto will be able to understand it maybe that's the case that seems to be the hoped for development that something like constructor theory might be able to provide I don't know constructor theory is still being developed but the formalism might be simple and maybe the

### 56m

ways in which matter can be arranged again is like the rules of a checkerboard it's just possible and impossible moves just like chess or checkers something simple like that you can do this but you can't do that rather than hey here's all the complex mathematical apparatus for predicting what will happen forget about that rather than predicting what will happen you will just have here are the possibilities that exist in physical space we can't say what will happen except in certain very narrow circumstances but overall as we know as we know the future is open ended so how do you accommodate this real part of physical reality namely that what people choose to do doesn't seem to be captured yet by physics but it's part of physical reality so how do you incorporate that inherent unpredictability of the growth of knowledge and people's choices and all that stuff within

### 57m

a conception of physics after all it needs to be as part of physics physics is about what happens in physical reality it's not just about predicting what ensembles of particles do that's part of it but it's such a tiny part of physical reality physics is broader than that physics includes the whole universe cosmology and bits of the universe that are simple like stars and complex stuff like the behaviour of biological organisms it's biology but they're still made of physical stuff and then super complicated stuff like lots and lots of particles all interacting under physical forces that's what people usually think of when they think physics they think in terms of energy particles and forces and yeah when you've got lots of those of course things get complex complicated but that's just one aspect of physics and predicting what those things are going to do

### 58m

but if you're not fixated on let's predict what those things are going to do if you understand that okay yeah maybe you want to be able to do that sometimes some of the time but if you also accept and just you know sort of relax into the idea that some things just get too complicated to predict so okay and in fact some things are inherently unpredictable because of this idea of free will human choice human creativity the inability to predict the growth of knowledge but this is all part of what happens in the physical world if you're comfortable steeped in ignorance as Neil deGrasse Tyson says then you can really do more interesting science you can just talk about this is possible this is impossible in the world this is why I'm excited about constructive theory it's a whole new way of looking at physics much more exciting and I've gotten so far away from talking about chapter 10 that you know we're at real risk of never getting

### 59m

through this chapter the point here is though that the book of nature isn't necessarily written in this complicated mathematics that you can just read this is what scientists, objectivists, Galileo got wrong it's just that hitherto it seems to have been written in mathematics but maybe it's written in something far more simple a more logical structure and you can call that logical structure mathematics if you like but you know are the rules of checkers or chess mathematics kind of the difference between basic baby logic in philosophy and complex mathematics like differential equations these two things have a logical structure and there is commonality there but splitting hairs over whether or not one's mathematics and one isn't okay let's read one more paragraph and reflect on that and call it a day for today and then we'll

### 1h 0m

pick it up and read more over the coming weeks David goes on to say quote do abstract non-physical entities exist are they part of the fabric of reality I'm not interested here in issues of mere word usage it is obvious that numbers the laws of physics and so on do exist in some senses and not in others the substantive question is now this how are we to understand such entities which of them are merely convenient forms of words referring ultimately only to ordinary physical reality which are merely ephemeral features of our culture which are arbitrary like the rules of a trivial game that we need only look up and which if any can be explained only in a way that attributes an independent existence to them things of this last type must

### 1h 1m

be part of the fabric of reality as defined in this book because one would have to understand them in order to understand everything that is understood end quote end of the reading for today let's reflect on that last point first the whole point of the fabric of reality and David's work broadly is to understand everything that is understood right now and so what struck me in that wonderful podcast with Lully and David was Lully's probing of David and pushing David on the point about the universality of computation and how it applied to let's say the existence of inexplicit ideas and what practical implications it might have and all that sort of stuff and it seemed to me David's point there was well he's trying to understand everything that is understood and what is understood by which we mean

### 1h 2m

what we have presently good explanations for includes the universality of computation so let's take that as read that's what we understand so if we want to understand other stuff hitherto not yet understood then one good starting place is to start deep fundamentally beneath what the brain is doing and what the mind is capable of doing and what's going on there in terms of physics which constrains the possibility of what these emergent things are able to do so let's take seriously this idea of the universality of computation which implies the brain is performing computations after all every physical system has this one to one correspondence between as I keep on saying what's going on in terms of the motion of particles or what the neurons

### 1h 3m

are doing and you know the possibility of simulating these things with a quantum computer so there is this direct link between computing stuff and the physical things so to understand everything that's understood that's going to be part of it part of the way in which we constrain the world now could the fundamental things that we understand right now be wrong absolutely but as I often say about these things that way lies kind of a dead end in terms of making progress it's possible that everything we know could be wrong but if you're going to assume that you're not going to get very far because all that's going to happen is you're contradicting all knowledge which is itself already a criticism of anything you might put forward so somehow you have to say first what's wrong with that deeper fundamental theory point that out

### 1h 4m

you might have this wonderfully self contained theory of psychology you know I often talk about Donald Hoffman right Donald Hoffman has this interesting idea about how well reality out there might not be anything like what we think it is which so far so good that's precisely what you know the fabric of reality kind of implies and the work of David Deutsch more broadly in the beginning of infinity kind of implies we don't get to final physical reality but then he he jumps to so therefore we don't have an understanding of physical reality at all all we have is a kind of interface which evolution has provided us with which could be completely misleading in all ways and then it gets a little bit wishy-washy then he steps beyond what we already know and he never connects with what we actually know he never talks about the universality

### 1h 5m

of computation he never talks about physics as we know it he just says he just asserts he just comes out with something that everyone has something that so many people have come out with before consciousness just is fundamental and it's the deepest thing it is what constrains everything else without ever saying what consciousness is except to say well he's got a mathematically precise theory of consciousness he doesn't he doesn't I've read the papers the papers that he's put out and prepare to be underwhelmed with the level of detail prepare to be underwhelmed with how he connects any of these things to physics he says that the physics actually comes out of his theory of consciousness which would be a good project if it was true but it's not true he doesn't ever extract general relativity and quantum theory from his theory of consciousness if he did then we could have something to talk about but he doesn't he just promises that this would be the case or will be the case in some future development of his theory but it hasn't

### 1h 6m

happened yet it's just a promise but he's at least thinking along the right lines that this is what it would take okay if he had a deeper theory of physics namely a physics of consciousness which then enabled us to predict to show how quantum theory in general relativity arose from his theory of consciousness then yeah he'd be right and if his theory of consciousness was testable which it isn't his so-called mathematical theory of consciousness just isn't anything like it it's just not and I think he it's sort of it's a little bit of a grift now unfortunately a lot of people are bamboozled by this they don't understand the mathematics the mathematics isn't particularly complicated and when you you look at it it's just it's it's just epistemological error after epistemological error disconnected from as I say the fundamental theory the fundamental explanation at the bottom the deepest we've gone

### 1h 7m

so far of physical reality which is the quantum theory of computation it brings together quantum theory our deepest known physical theory with computation the deepest understanding of how information processing works it unites them together it therefore constrains what is possible for minds to do what knowledge can be created and how it can be created all of that stuff so knowledge creation exists in this substrate if you like this this this it's kind of for want of another word nested within all these things are nested within this universality of computation that's at the bottom it's not to say it's the final bottom that it's a proper foundation but David Deutsch works at the foundations while denying that foundations are a final ultimate thing a foundation just means it touches all these other areas a foundational deep

### 1h 8m

theory has connections to and constrains what all these other more emergent things say about the world it can work in both directions but you've got to figure out a way to refute that particular theory before you go and say well my theory of consciousness just it gets deeper than that without ever explaining exactly how or what's wrong critiquing the universality of computation so you need to take that seriously you need to take what we know seriously so far and so that's what David's doing so when he talks to Lully about this and he's kind of saying yeah I'm interested in what you have to say about this inexplicit stuff I want to understand it better but hitherto mind you haven't heard a proper good explanation of this stuff

### 1h 9m

by the way maybe by the time this is published they will have released their next conversation where the promise is of Lully talking about how the deeper theory the deeper theory that she says can be incorporated within David Deutsch's world view that these things work together that there is a substantive good explanation there so perhaps but at the moment it seems like from what David has heard that his world view and this other kind of stuff about psychology can indeed work together and from what I've heard by the way just for what it's worth I think everything Lully says is quite right you know that the human body reacts to inexplicit ideas absolutely absolutely you know we carry around these inexplicit ideas we develop tension in our body and we don't know why the tension is there quite often and finding the cause of the tension can help you to relax and feel better and all

### 1h 10m

that kind of stuff you know you have to be careful with these things you know Sam Harris has this great story about how when he first got into meditation he used to think of himself that he was just so relaxed about everything that he would go around just staring into people's eyes because he was so relaxed and he realised that this wasn't a way of being relaxed this was a way of in fact quite the opposite of making other people feel very uncomfortable sort of it was a little bit deranged and he realised that this is not true enlightenment or insight they're just looking into someone's eyes and being very very comfortable and you know it's a bit of a and he admits himself that there was a kind of dishonesty to the whole thing that he was just kind of pretending you know seeming to be relaxed and just looking at people and you know staring intently at people's eyes because he just felt that he was just so enlightened that this

### 1h 11m

was the way in which you were able to convey to people how relaxed you are and how much you understood them and that you were present in their presence and all this sort of stuff so anyway he talks about that and I do get that sense sometimes with some people sometimes who tend in the direction of let's say certain kinds of practices like that that there's a genuine risk of not connecting with people but distancing yourself from other people. Not that Lily's doing this I'm just saying that within the world of psychology mindfulness self-help, self-improvement all that kind of thing there in the Venn diagram of those people and reasonable versions of that there is some crossover at times with you know that concept of all the zeal of a convert you know learning about certainly

### 1h 12m

you get this within Popperian circles absolutely people new to Popperian circles and I fully encourage people to take the idea seriously but there is a risk sometimes you know and I may very well have been this I know I was certainly this when I first encountered atheism certainly I was the worst kind of atheist when I first read Dawkins and I read Harris on this I became one of those evangelical atheists I just wanted to convince everyone that religion was ridiculous you know and you get especially if you're coming out of something like Christianity and then of course it takes some for want of another word degree of enlightenment to realize hey it's not all bad you know yeah you figured out something that there's a lot of nonsense there in religion but you don't have to evangelize in exactly the same way that recent converts to religion will evangelize all the zeal of a convert

### 1h 13m

you have to be especially critical and people who are new to Popperian epistemology have to really take seriously the idea that the criticism applies to them and Popperian epistemology as well I go out there I evangelize to some extent about the work of David Deutsch and Karl Popper absolutely but you have to be careful about this zeal that you're not berating bashing people over the head with it and you're being critical about the way in which you're explaining things and so a self-help is like this the self-help movement oftentimes has this sort of zeal that can be somewhat off-putting to people not yet persuaded by it and so I certainly see this in Popperian circles and I balk at it and I cringe at it because I think that this is the kind of thing that I used to do that if you're new to it

### 1h 14m

you just want to tell everyone you're so enthusiastic but the problem is it works against you objectivists are wonderful at this by the way wonderful in the the bad sense they're filled with zeal and it's one of the reasons there are many reasons why people are put off the work of Ayn Rand because the zeal is so much like religion obviously it's not religion I think they're right about so many things but the proponents of objectivism the work of Ayn Rand are ever trying to persuade people in very enthusiastic and emotional ways and accusing others of being you know enemies or mixed as I often complain about that unless you are fully on board then there's something wrong with your mind all the zeal of a

### 1h 15m

convert it turns people off so we always everywhere have to be careful of that and again I've gone off onto a rant that has absolutely nothing to do with this chapter so let me just go back to David's questions here so moving all the way back to the beginning of his list of questions here he says do abstract non-physical entities exist so he's going to explain that yes they do and in chapter 5 of the beginning of infinity the reality of abstractions clearly he's coming down on the side of yes they do exist and he explains a whole bunch of reasons why these abstract entities have real physical effects in the world the most prominent example is knowledge knowledge is an abstract thing by the measure at it's independent of any physical instantiation so it's independent of whether you write it on paper or you type it on a keyboard or see it in pixels or however the knowledge happens to be represented

### 1h 16m

you know in mind it goes on to have these causal effects on physical things so the abstract knowledge exists and not only does it exist it has real physical effects in the world David then asks are they part of the fabric of reality absolutely he says it is obvious that numbers the laws of physics and so on do exist in some sense and not in others by the way the laws of physics are a really curious example of a kind of abstraction they're an abstraction in the sense that well they're not made of matter that's the first thing forces are not laws of physics they're explained by the laws of physics but then there are the ultimate final laws of physics idealizations in some ways the things that actually govern the universe and then there's our knowledge of those laws of physics you know we first thought that Aristotle had an idea of the laws of physics he was wrong then Galileo his version was

### 1h 17m

incomplete and wrong Newton we thought he was correct for centuries turned out to be wrong Einstein came along and improved on Newton's classical physics showing that it was wrong in a whole bunch of ways but it was still incomplete quantum theory then augmented and sort of was in opposition to much of relativity and never really has fit with it but taken together these two things cannot simultaneously be true because it's the distinction between the discrete and the continuous so we're still moving towards an understanding of the laws of physics now understanding of the laws of physics is itself an abstraction our knowledge of the laws of physics is an abstraction about an abstraction the ultimate laws of physics so all these abstract things exist talking about physical stuff that's made of matter David goes on to say the substantive question is this how are we to understand such entities which of them are merely convenient forms of words referring ultimately only to ordinary

### 1h 18m

physical reality which are merely ephemeral features of our culture which are arbitrary like the rules of a trivial game that we only need to look up end quote so that's the question of well stuff like the literal rules of chess and checkers that's not Feynman's point Feynman's point was to say are the laws of physics this deep truth about reality going to turn out to be like the rules of a checkerboard he's not saying they will be the rules of a checkerboard the rules of a checkerboard are arbitrary and cultural and you know this little side issue about you know a game okay these don't have any fundamental significance but the laws of physics will the laws of physics will absolutely of course have fundamental significance so is our next best understanding of the laws of physics going to be simple like the rules of a checkerboard which you won't just look up okay David's question is we can look up the rules of a game they're abstract but you know you

### 1h 19m

just read the rule book and there it is but you can't read the rule book of nature that's Galileo's mistake so there we go I think that's it for today it's been a long podcast about just the introductory remarks of this wonderful chapter a chapter we can look at with fresh eyes on TopCast given David's recent relatively recent last few years speech at the acceptance of his award for the Dirac medal one of the Dirac medals that he won two but the most recent one he talked about the mathematician's misconception that sort of built upon his work in the beginning of infinity where the reality of abstractions and that kind of thing and fallibilism and the work of Karl Popper and that built upon what is here in the fabric of reality all of which comes out of this deep deep truth that he has

### 1h 20m

come to explain for the first time ever about the link between quantum theory and computation about how all physical systems obey the laws of physics of necessity that's a necessary truth about the world logical truth about the world so if you take that seriously what falls out of that what are the consequences in particular what are the consequences for people generating knowledge how does it mesh with Popper's own fundamental ideas about epistemology and how knowledge is created fits perfectly well it's a physical explanation of Popper's abstract understanding of the fallibility and the error prone nature of conjecturing knowledge about the world reality has no contradictions it's our job to try and resolve the contradictions in our knowledge

### 1h 21m

of reality so when you have apparent perfection in physics as Newtonian mechanics kind of gave us here's everything is just deterministic and everything just as a matter of fact obeys these physical laws that give you perfectly precise predictions how can that possibly marry up with but look at the real world it's unpredictable what do you do then do you just say well it's just too complex for us to understand it's not inherently unpredictable it's just that there's an intractability problem there well that kind of exists but there's something deeper to say about this the universality of quantum computation talks about how quantum systems have this inherent fuzziness about them the inkblot notion the all different physically possible things

### 1h 22m

actually exist out there in the multiverse in some way what we choose to do affects the branch in which our consciousness and creativity generates objects these large things in physical space the physical space of the multiverse and so all of that comes to bear on a reason why human beings are fallible make choices and create knowledge it works together beautifully it's a beautiful synthesis of epistemology on the one hand and fundamental physics on the other philosophy and physics coming together and this is why again there's so many reasons why i've talked about even in this episode why constructive theory is so exciting but it brings together you know two of my deep passions fundamental physics and epistemology it provides an opportunity for a way of unifying these as i've said a few times before

### 1h 23m

especially in my series with on chiara maleta's work can we have a true physics of epistemology constructive theory opens the door to that kind of thing that's thrilling and exciting the possibility of figuring out what knowledge is possible and impossible to create what abstractions are impossible to understand perhaps that's the work of girdle and turing and what abstractions we can come to understand better and how we can possibly make knowledge perhaps possibly make knowledge fast in some places but we are restricted to only ever making very slow and incremental knowledge about certain things in other areas these are open questions that constructive theory illuminates for us or at least provides us the opportunity for asking and therefore answering at some point in the future but
