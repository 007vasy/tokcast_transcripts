Welcome to TopCast and to part one of my exploration of, and commentary upon, time travel, which is chapter 12 of The Fabric of Reality. We've spoken about time itself, the nature of it, and in particular the quantum nature of time. The Fabric of Reality, therefore, has already given us a hint that time, whether viewed in the classical physics of Newton, where it ticks away independently outside of the universe, or of Einstein, where it is intimately tied to space, and like space itself, is a dynamic player on the stage, rather than some sort of inert background within which things happen. But augmenting that perspective of time, the best one, Einstein's, where time can move faster or slower depending upon the relative motion between clocks, and that includes, by the way, people with biological clocks, doesn't just include those things that we think of with a little hand and a big hand, a digital readout. Any physical process can be regarded as clock, something that is recording time, so to speak, or at least telling us the rate

### 1m

at which time is passing. Language struggles to conjure what's actually going on at the level of physics, as we saw in the last chapter. Anyway, augmenting that view of time, Einstein's, with the Everettian picture of quantum theory, leads to some conceptual difficulties, but also to some new solutions. And we're going to see some of those solutions in this chapter, to what are called, sometimes, paradoxes in time, especially time travel. Those include things like the grandfather paradox. One of the great reliefs in embracing something like Everettian quantum theory, the many-world interpretation, the multiverse, in other words, is that whenever anyone starts to talk about the paradoxes with quantum theory, the mystery that is quantum theory, the illogical consequences of thinking through quantum theory, all that kind of stuff, it's almost all resolved, in my experience, thus far, by simply recalling that we live in a multiverse. That's how these things are resolved.

### 2m

And we're going to see some of that again in this chapter. But we're also going to see that, as David has brought up throughout previous chapters of The Fabric of Reality, the centrality of the significance of virtual reality for our understanding of some of these big issues. And in particular, this one here with time travel. Remember that what we experience, and this, in fact, is a key insight from The Fabric of Reality, and it deeply permeates the way in which David Deutsch conjures and speaks about and explains the philosophy of Karl Popper. We might even give Plato his due credit here. The notion that we are minds, and the minds run on brains, and the brains are encased within the complete darkness of our skulls. And the only way they have access to, what we might call external reality, is via the eyes connected to that brain via the optic nerve,

### 3m

and the ears connected to the brain via the auditory nerve. External reality in the form of photons and compression waves in air, that sound, must first be detected by those imperfect gatherers of photons and sound waves, then translated into electrical signals that travel along those nerves before they enter the brain, where another process, process of interpretation goes on. In other words, we're already living in virtual reality. Our minds, after all, are not presenting us with reality, but an interpretation of. So I am just underscoring here why it is, and why it will be, that in this chapter, David will make a big deal about virtual reality. And this sometimes escapes people in my experience when I speak to them about this chapter in particular. It's like, why is virtual reality coming up again? Well, because it is central to, our understanding of what a person is and the person's relationship to physical reality.

### 4m

That's a big deal. That's a huge deal that we inhabit as our minds interpreting imperfect channels of data running along those nerves. And that constitutes a form of virtual reality. Now, to be fair to Plato, he seemed to be one of the first to come up with this, you know, people trapped inside of a cave. Of course, I think his emphasis of slightly wrong and the virtual reality picture gives us a more scientifically accurate way of actually thinking. That thought experiment's true, if you like. Our minds are simulating for us. So far as that's not a tautology. You might want to say, our minds are simulating for our consciousness. Again, is that a tautology? Anyway, our minds are simulating what is happening beyond our eyes, beyond our ears and other senses. And so we're going to read about virtual reality again in order to get a handle on this concept of time travel. Enough forestalling for now. It's going to take a few parts for me to get through this chapter because there are just so many interesting twists and turns. And there's also

### 5m

quite a bit of science that I want to unpack along the way. So you might be interested in delving more deeply into the physics. And I'll do that to a limited extent. After all, time travel is about space-time and space-time is the domain of relativity. And if you're ever interested, people often ask me, you know, what books are good to learn this or that subject? And I often do not have many good recommendations. But if you're interested in an introduction to special relativity, I'll give you a few examples. So I'll give you a few examples. I'll give you a few examples. So I'll give you a few examples. So I'll give you a few examples. So let's get started. And a very brief introduction to general relativity for what's worse. One of the textbooks that I was assigned to use when I was at university was this one here, Space-Time Physics by Taylor and Wheeler. Yes, that is John Archibald Wheeler. He's one of the authors of this. It's a fantastic book. It's very easy to read. You can, if you want to, skip over a lot of the mathematics. But in fact, the mathematics is done in an algebraic way. So it's quite straightforward. It's not like you need, you know, tensor calculus on manifolds or anything like that. You don't have to do triple integrals or solve differential equations.

### 6m

It's pretty straightforward stuff. And special relativity can be understood deeply as long as you get the basics of algebra and a little bit of geometry, perhaps, and understand how graphs work. It's not overly mathematically intense. Conceptually, it can be a mind spinner. And in fact, I think conceptually, if you're going to embrace the multiverse, you will find quantum theory conceptually far simpler to understand, I think, than aspects of special relativity. Just this very notion that we don't have a common sense experience of, of length, contraction, time dilation, which we will come to today. I'm forestalling still, so let me get into the reading. So, chapter 12, time travel, and David begins. It is a natural thought, given the idea that time is in some ways like an additional fourth dimension of space, that if it is possible to travel from one place to another, perhaps it is also possible to travel from one time to another.

### 7m

We saw in the previous chapter that the idea of moving through time in the sense in which we move through space does not make sense. Nevertheless, it seems clear what one would mean by travelling to the 25th century or to the age of the dinosaurs. In science fiction, time machines are usually envisaged as exotic vehicles. One sets the controls to the date and time of one's chosen destination, waits while the vehicle travels to that date and time, sometimes one can choose the place as well, and there one is. If one has chosen the distant future, one converses with conscious robots and marvels at interstellar spacecraft, or, depending on the political persuasion of the author, one wanders among charred radioactive ruins. End quote. Part of that reminds me of what is not normally regarded as a time travel movie, but it's certainly a science fiction movie of the first rate, I would say, which is Contact, starring Jodie Fisher and Matthew McConaughey.

### 8m

And Jodie Fisher is an astronomer, astrophysicist, radio astronomer, I think, and Matthew McConaughey is some sort of religious advisor. He's not quite a priest, but, you know, he is a religious advisor to the president or something or other. Anyway, one of the themes in the movie is this exploration of the supposed tension between religious faith and the hard-nosed scientific rationality. And there's an aspect of time travel in that wherein they build the time machine. The plot is something like aliens transmit plans for this spacecraft which travels through a wormhole and goes to another galaxy where the star, Jodie Fisher's character, travels all the way to this other galaxy, meets the aliens and comes back and gives a report to the press and to the people and to the world, you know, telling them that we are not alone, although we already know that we are not alone precisely because we got plans from the aliens from the other galaxy.

### 9m

I think it's something like that. Anyway, the time travel aspect is that when they start running the time machine, they sort of have, it's a spherical thing and they drop it and it falls down to the ocean. From the outside, it appears as if the spherical spacecraft just falls straight into the ocean and as much time passes as it takes for the spacecraft to fall in the ocean, approximately, 200 meters or something. Okay, so that's one thing. Now, Jodie Foster's character insists that she went on a big journey, but there is no evidence of this. She just had the experience of many hours passing, maybe days. But anyway, she travels a long way through a wormhole to another galaxy, meets the alien, talks to the alien, comes back and so all this time has passed for her, but for the spacecraft, no time at all. And one of the irritating parts of the movie is at the end where Matthew McConaughey, is talking to Jodie Foster's character

### 10m

and says, well, you know, this is kind of what it's like to be religious. You know, you have these experiences and you're trying to tell people that you really have had them, but there's no evidence. And so sometimes you just have to take things on faith. And, you know, Jodie Foster sort of nods along and kind of is, she loses the argument essentially because she has these deeply felt clues that she has experienced. Now, of course, the irritating part, part of it is that in fact, there is evidence because Jodie Foster's character was recording audio the entire time. And part of the twists and turns in the movie is that the scientists who are analyzing the audio say, oh, it's recorded nothing but static. So apparently no evidence. However, it didn't just record static. It recorded, I think they said six hours worth of static. So that is direct evidence that the spacecraft did something very strange happened with resources. And that's the thing. It did something very strange. It did something very strange. It time traveled six hours for the spacecraft,

### 11m

but only a few seconds for outside observers. So my mind went straight to that when David was talking about these vehicles, these vehicles that sometimes might be regarded as spacecraft, this traveling through space, but they're also traveling through time if they're traveling fast enough, especially in that particular case, they're traveling through a wormhole, a huge bend or loop in space time. And they're just at the end of what I read. David said, depending upon the political persuasion of the author, if you travel into the future, one wonders among charred radioactive ruins, which is a wonderful premonition of the kind of rejection of pessimism we would get from David in the beginning of infinity, quite obviously. So even then back in 1997, he was of one mind with himself later on in understanding that how you envisage the future and quite often, these days, science fiction writers envisage the future as a dystopian hellscape where nuclear apocalypse

### 12m

has happened and there's basically nothing left but charred radioactive. But it need not be that. And in fact, if we continue to follow the trajectory we have been following since the enlightenment, we should expect the future to be much better and brighter and wiser and more wonderful than what we experienced today. Anyway, let's continue with the reading. David goes on to say, quote, if one has chosen the distant past, one fights off an attack by Tyrannosaurus rex while pterodactyls flutter overhead. The presence of dinosaurs would be impressive evidence that we really had reached an earlier era. We should be able to cross-check this evidence and determine the date more precisely by observing some natural long-term calendar, such as the shapes of constellations in the night sky or the relative proportions of various radioactive elements in rocks. Physics provides many such calendars and the laws of physics cause them to agree with one another when suitably calibrated. End quote. Now, just pausing there and, you know,

### 13m

my commentary on this is I love this sort of stuff, you know, the idea that you could travel into the past and figure out when you are, even if you were dropped off randomly by the time machine and you didn't know when you had arrived at. One of the more interesting ones as an astrophysics person would be taking a precise measurement of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. Today, it's 2.7001 or whatever it happens. And as you go into the past, that number rises higher and higher. In fact, there is a formula relating the temperature to the time at which, or the time compared to today, 13.7 billion years later. And so this is the temperature and time equation for the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. Now, how would you take such a temperature of the cosmic microwave background? We just need the small wrinkle of requiring you to have a space satellite of some sort that can actually do this. Just like COBE or the Planck satellite or something like that.

### 14m

But if you're building a time machine, it can't be that hard to press a button on your time machine, which will tell you what the cosmic microwave background temperature is, just to triple check what year you happen to be in. But anyway, you could cross-check that with the radioactivity of uranium, fossil record, any number of things like that. David goes on to say, quote, according to the approximation that the multiverse consists of a set of parallel spacetimes, each consisting of a set of parallel spacetimes, each consisting of a set of parallel spacetimes, which is a stack of snapshots of space. The date defined in this way is a property of an entire snapshot. And any two snapshots are separated by a time interval, which is the difference between their dates. Time travel is any process that causes a disparity between, on the one hand, this interval between two snapshots, and on the other, our own experience of how much time has elapsed between our being in those two snapshots. We might refer to a clock that we carry with us, or we might estimate, how much thinking we have had the opportunity to do, or we might measure by physiological criteria

### 15m

how much our bodies have aged. James Crowe pausing there, my reflection on that. Clocks that we carry with us in relativity record or report what is known as proper time. And in these formulae, for example, this one for time dilation, the T subscript naught is the proper time. So if you are moving around, at a high rate of knots, at high velocity, the wristwatch that you happen to have, or a clock on the wall, which is moving with you, that is recording the proper time. And it doesn't matter how fast you go, your wristwatch will always appear to tick at the usual rate. You will never notice anything unusual. It's only if you look outside your reference frame. If my room here that I happen to be sitting in was traveling at 99% the speed of light, everything inside the room, would appear to be normal to me, it's only if I looked out the window at things that are not moving at 99% the speed of light,

### 16m

that are effectively stationary with respect to me, that I would notice something very unusual. I'd notice a number of unusual things. There would be length contraction in the direction of motion, so things would be all squished up. But also, and more importantly for our purposes here, in discussions of time, clocks would tick more slowly. Time would be moving more slowly outside of the room in which I'm traveling, which is traveling at the closest bit of light. And you can calculate by how much. In fact, using this formula, we've got t naught, the proper time, which is the time that is appearing on my wristwatch, t v, which is the time ticking away outside of my room, and v, of course, is the velocity at which you're traveling. Now, the interesting thing about this formula, by the way, one of the many interesting things about this formula, again, if you're interested in this stuff, special relativity is, you know, you can learn the basics of special relativity in a day. I've got a number of videos online, that actually cover some of this stuff. One of the interesting things is, you will notice the term there that reads

### 17m

one minus v squared over c squared, where v is your velocity and c is the speed of light. So as your velocity v approaches what the speed of light is, one minus v over c gets closer and closer to being zero. Now, why is that? Well, because if you're traveling at the speed of light, then that means that you get anywhere that you like, as fast as you like, which means that if you're a, a photon, if you're a particle of light traveling at c, then you've got one minus c squared over c squared, and that's clearly zero. So as, as the photon, as the photon, it appears to you, if you had a consciousness as a photon, you would get everywhere instantly. And photons do get everywhere instantly in their frame of reference. This can sometimes be very hard for people to accept. So I'll say it again. If we consider something like, how long does it take a photon of light to get from the sun to the earth? Almost everyone can reel off the number. Eight minutes. It takes eight minutes.

### 18m

Now that's according to us. We're watching the photon, how long it takes to get from the sun to the earth. But if you were the photon, you would seem to be produced at the surface of the sun, and then you would arrive at the surface of the earth instantly. No time would pass for you. You wouldn't experience any time whatsoever. And in fact, that applies, even if you travel across the galaxy, 120,000 light years. According to us, it takes light 120,000 years to travel from one side of the galaxy to the other, hence the size of the galaxy being 120,000 light years across. But if you're a photon, traveling from one star at one far edge of the galaxy to the other side of the galaxy, it takes you zero time. Photons get everywhere in zero time. This is just a consequence of the laws of physics, in particular, special relativity, and further in particular, the time dilation equation right there. But anyway, t naught is proper time, and a clock in special relativity,

### 19m

I will emphasize again, is not just a wristwatch. It's not just a Big Ben type analog clock. It's any physical process. These things mark time, if you like. These things have time is in the instant, as Julian Barber would say. Okay, let us persevere. David goes on to write, quote, If we observe that a long time has passed externally, while by all subjective measures, we have experienced a much shorter time than we have traveled into the future. If, on the other hand, we observe the external clocks and calendars indicating a particular time, and later subjectively, we observe them consistently indicating an earlier time than we have traveled into the past, end quote. Yes, sir. In other words, on that, we are always traveling into the future. You know, subjectively, we experience a later time than what the present is, then we're traveling into the future. But it's also worth at this juncture, just mentioning that not only are we getting a hint of the physically objective process of time dilation,

### 20m

but also the subjective sense of time dilation, if you like. And David will come to this, but you know, it's that idea of when you're having fun, time flies. Or if you're bored waiting at the dentist room, time seems to drag on. If you fall asleep and then you wake up, it doesn't seem like, you know, seven, eight or nine hours has actually passed, but something less than that. And almost everyone who, undergoes an operation and a general anesthetic reports that it seems like they were being given the gas mask and they're waiting for the doctor to, to put them to sleep only for them to wake up and to still be waiting for the operation to begin. You know, they, you have this very warped sense of time. Are these forms of time travel? Yeah, I guess so. And the reason I say I guess so is because time in my mind, and I've mentioned Jerome linear before at this point, although we don't have a physical theory of this,

### 21m

and this is wild conjecture, if you like, it seems to be intimately tied in a sense to this mystery of consciousness. The present moment that we occupy, according to physics is not special. The past exists. The future exists. This is the block universe idea, but we experience only now experience. I say, so immediately, I'm bringing in consciousness subjectivity. Now consciousness and subjectivity for no part of the theory of relativity or quantum theory or any physical theory. And yet as a matter of fact, there seems to be something special about the present moment. But then the retort to saying there seems to be something special about the present moment is, well, that's only from your perspective. After all, would you be tempted to say there's something special about being here? Here is not special. I've just chosen to be here, but I could be over there. I could be in London. I could be in New York.

### 22m

I could be anywhere, but I'm here. Why is it special? It's just because I'm located here. And so too with the present moment. It's just that I don't get to make much of a choice about when I am, even if I can choose where I am. I think there's still some kind of mystery here. Copies of me in the past are conscious of the past and copies of me in the future are conscious of their times as well. But something seems special now. And I have talked before and I wrote the transcript once to this wonderful podcast that David did many, many years ago. Unpacking why it is that our perspective on time isn't necessarily much more mysterious than our perspective on a particular statue. We can't see all sides of a statue simultaneously, but that doesn't present a deep mystery. At the foundations of physics or anything like that. So we shouldn't think it any more mysterious that we can't experience all times simultaneously either.

### 23m

We experience an instant. Nonetheless, things do feel weird and sometimes well, I find myself struggling to reconcile the idea of physics, where there is no special time singled out by the equations past, present and future all exist in the same. Why nothing is singled out as being special and my experience, which is always located in the now. So what is the now apart from consciousness? But if it's consciousness, then there is a consciousness in the past. But then of course, if you're never ready and you must be committed to the idea that the past and the future has special cases of other universes. And so it's no more mysterious that I'm not conscious of the past, but a copy of me is, then that in a parallel universe, where I chose to do something other than record this podcast today, that copy of me is having a different conscious experience to what I am.

### 24m

I'm just always in a particular universe, but memories are also being laid down. Yeah, there are a lot of questions here. Let's keep going. David goes on to say, Most authors of science fiction realize that future and past directed time travel are radically different sorts of process. I shall not give future directed time travel much attention here, because it is by far the less problematic proposition. Even in everyday life, for example, when we sleep and wake up, our subjectively experienced time can be shorter than the external elapsed time. People who recover from comas lasting several years could be said to have traveled that many years into the future, were it not for the fact their bodies have aged accordingly to external time, rather than the time they experienced subjectively. So in principle, a technique similar to that, which we envisage in chapter five for slowing down a virtual reality, used as brain, could be applied to the whole body and thus could be used for fully fledged future directed time travel.

### 25m

A less intrusive method is provided by Einstein's special theory of relativity, which says that in general, an observer who accelerates or decelerates experiences less time than an observer who is at rest or in uniform motion. For example, an astronaut who went on a round trip involving acceleration to speeds closer to that of light would experience much less time than an observer who remained on Earth. This effect is known as, time dilation. By accelerating enough, one can make the duration of the flight from the astronauts point of view as short as one likes, and the duration is measured on Earth as long as one likes. Thus, one could travel as far into the future as one likes in a given subjectively short time. But such a trip to the future is irreversible. The return journey would require past direct time travel, and no amount of time dilation can allow a spaceship to return from a flight before it took off. End quote. So there's a few things to talk about here. The first thing. I was going through before the idea that if I'm here in my room, and my room is some sort of spacecraft,

### 26m

or super advanced form of transport, and it's able to travel at high proportions of the speed of light, let's say 99% of the speed of light, and I'm zipping along, then inside of my room, clocks like my wristwatch, and the clock on the wall, whatever else, all appear to be behaving normally. Everything appears to be as normal. Clocks tick at the same rate. One second per second. And so on. I'm aging in the same way. Everything is aging in the same way within my room that is zipping along at close to the speed of light. However, when I look outside the window, I notice everything appears to have slowed down. All clocks are ticking more slowly. All biological processes are running more slowly. And so on. Now the theory of relativity says, special relativity, that those people on the outside, when they look at me zipping past, it may as well be that they're moving, and I'm stationary. Okay. If it's uniform motion, if we're both tracking, that's Galileo, right? There's no preferred frame of reference.

### 27m

There's no absolute frame of reference in that sense. So they would be on the ground, let's say, if I'm zipping across overhead at very close to the speed of light. They're there, and they're looking at their wristwatches, and clocks on the wall, and biological, observing biological processes, and going, nothing appears to be unusual to us. The only thing unusual is that there is a spacecraft, zipping across at close to the speed of light. Now, if they could look inside of my room, and they could see the clock on the wall, or my wristwatch, they would say, aha, Brett's clock is ticking more slowly. So we have a disagreement there. I would be looking at their clock saying, your clocks are ticking more slowly. And they would be looking at my clock saying, your clocks are ticking more slowly. So who is right? We're both right. Okay. On special relativity, we are both absolutely right. It's just uniform motion. Okay. If I'm traveling at 99%, at the speed of light, then is it me who's traveling at 99% of the speed of light, zipping along? Or equally so,

### 28m

is it I'm at rest, I'm at rest, and everything is rushing backwards, close to the speed of light. Special relativity has nothing to say about this. Now, this introduces a so-called paradox. It's not a paradox. It's just a problem given to undergraduates to try and explain. It's known as the twin paradox. So let's explain the twin paradox. The twin paradox is this. Let's say you've got two twins, A and B. Okay. A stays on the Earth, and B goes for a rocket trip at, you know, some high percentage of the speed of light. Let's say that twin B, the one who leaves the Earth, decides to go away for 10 years. He rockets away from the Earth at 80% the speed of light. Okay. So it takes five years to get over to some destination somewhere. And then he immediately turns around, comes back, and travels another five years at 80% the speed of light, returning to Earth. Now, the fact is that he will come back, appearing to be four years younger than the one who remained on the Earth.

### 29m

The one who remains on the Earth will say, hey, that journey that you went on took 10 years. But twin B, the one who was actually traveling says, no, no, no, it only took six years according to my clocks. Now, how can that be so, given what I said earlier? After all, wouldn't twin A look at twin B zooming along, and say, their clocks are ticking more slowly, and wouldn't twin B look back at the Earth saying, no, no, no, no, your clocks are ticking more slowly. So it's perfectly symmetrical like that. So if it's perfectly symmetrical, who in fact is younger? Should either be younger? Shouldn't they just both be the same age? What the heck is going on? Well, it's not the same kind of thought experiment. In the first thought experiment, I gave you that I was traveling around at 99% the speed of light, looking out the window and noticing the clocks outside were ticking more slowly, and the people on the ground, looking at me, saying, no, no, no, your clocks are ticking more slowly. That's symmetrical. It's a symmetrical situation. Both people are correct there. What's not the same in the twin experiment,

### 30m

the twin thought experiment, where the twin travels away from the Earth, and then comes back, is acceleration. Acceleration makes all the difference. In order for the thought experiment to actually work, what has to happen for twin B, is twin B is the one who is in the rock, he accelerates away for some amount of time, eventually reaches the destination after five years of travel, according to twin A. Twin B, it says it only takes three years. But upon arrival at the destination, a number of things have to happen. One, the brakes have to be applied, decelerating the rocket from 80% speed of light down to zero, stopping, turning around, re-accelerating to 80% speed, 80% the speed of light, and returning to the Earth. In other words, that twin, twin B, is experiencing a kind of motion that twin A never did. Twin B experiences a whole bunch of forces on their body,

### 31m

decelerations, coming to a stop, and then accelerations. That makes all the difference in terms of relativity to how fast the clocks are actually ticking. And so, therefore, the situations are not symmetrical, unlike with me looking out the window of my room, which is traveling at 99% speed, which is the speed of light. And so you do the mathematics of this using the time dilation equation, and you can calculate that if you're traveling at 80% the speed of light for five years, according to a person at rest, it will take you six years in order to complete the journey, according to the traveling twin, as compared to 10 years, according to the one who remains at rest. So twin B will be four years younger than what twin A happens to be. And that resolves the problem. There's no real paradox there at all. But sometimes people do get confused when they first start learning about relativity, that both people can say,

### 32m

no, you're the one with the slow moving clocks. No, you're the one with the slow moving clocks. Yes, that's the first kind of level at which you learn. Okay, so then you have to move from there to dealing with acceleration, which is a different thing. By the way, at this point, it's worth also mentioning, and I've talked about this in previous podcasts as well, and can we test, special relativity? Yes, of course we can. We can test it against classical Newtonian physics. We do it all the time. Not only the Large Hadron Collider, one of the more famous natural experiments that happens is the half-life of the particle known as a muon. Muons are particles which are similar to electrons, but they've got more mass. They're unstable, which is the key thing, and they decay into other particles. And they're produced in the other upper atmosphere by collisions between cosmic rays, that hit the atmosphere from all sorts of weird astrophysical cosmological processes. Okay, perhaps a supernova goes off, but perhaps a quasar shoots out something, whatever. We get these cosmic rays crashing into the upper atmosphere.

### 33m

When they crash into the upper atmosphere, they literally collide with things like nitrogen atoms. And when they collide with a nitrogen atom, it blows the nitrogen atom apart. Long story short, one thing that can be produced is this muon. And the muon, as I say, has a half-life. And the half-life is 2.2 microseconds on average. Now, that's if they're at rest, if they're at rest. And so you can produce these things in the laboratory, and you can measure their half-life, and you go, ah, the muon, it has a very stable half-life. On average, the half-life is 2.2 microseconds. This means that if you could accelerate a muon to the speed of light instantly, it would travel, at most, 660 meters. Before it disappears, okay? At the speed of light, you will get 660 meters if your half-life is 2.2 microseconds. However,

### 34m

here's the great mystery. Cosmic rays produce muons in the upper atmosphere at an altitude of some 10 to 15 kilometers. And yet, they're detected on the ground. So how can it be possible, if a muon traveling at the speed of light, which they can't do, they can only travel at less than the speed of light, only photons can travel at the speed of light. So the muons have to be traveling at less than the speed of light. But a muon traveling at the speed of light would only get 660 meters, but a muon produced in the upper atmosphere can travel 10 to 15 kilometers. Square that circle. How can the muon travel so far with such a short half-life? Because of time dilation. Okay? So this is a, a very rigorous test of special relativity that special relativity survives. In other words, to explain this qualitatively without doing calculations,

### 35m

if the muon was wearing a wristwatch, and here we are on the Earth, and we're looking at the muon and its wristwatch, its wristwatch appears to be ticking very slowly. So it's marking time much more slowly, and it doesn't get to 2.2 microseconds. Maybe it only gets to, 1.5 microseconds before it hits the detector. It's created at 10 to 15 kilometers above the Earth, and it's wristwatch then, and all the processes, all the internal physical processes inside of the muon are ticking away very slowly indeed. Now, according to the muon, of course, it's watching its wristwatch and it's going, well, I've got 2.2 microseconds to survive. Now, another way of putting this, by the way, is length contraction. And so if it's moving really fast near the speed of light, not at the speed of light, near the speed of light, some fraction of the speed of light, then it doesn't see 10 to 15 kilometers, by the way. What it sees is something significantly less than that. Maybe it sees only 300 meters. This is length contraction. So there are many ways to resolve this in special relativity,

### 36m

but it's a test of special relativity, and it illustrates this notion of time dilation, which is, in essence, a form of time travel. So when people doubt, and they do doubt, things like the twin paradox, so-called twin paradox, as being a real, a phenomenon, in other words, if you could travel at some high proportion of the speed of light for a long time, then you would arrive back younger than your twin happens to be. Time would pass more slowly for you. People can sometimes reject that. And you do, the famous, of course, example is Paul Davies talks about it in one of his books, that when he was working in London as a young lecturer, that he would often receive many, many, or read many, many letters that tried to, to disprove special relativity. Relativity has always been the subject of ire among many people who don't really understand relativity. They just refuse to accept that you can't travel fast in the speed of light.

### 37m

Time does indeed slow down the faster you go. All of this kind of stuff, for whatever reason, it causes anger among some people. But we have experiments. We have experiments that demand an explanation. The explanation is things like, time dilation. But even though if you were a twin traveling in a rocket ship away from the Earth and then back again, and you would appear to be younger than your twin, it wouldn't matter how fast you traveled. As David says there, the spaceship cannot possibly return before it takes off. If it's traveling arbitrarily close to the speed of light, it will take off and return as quickly as you like, even if it, you know, you can take it over the other side of the galaxy, 120,000 light years away, and back again in an arbitrarily short amount of time. The difficulty in reality is you'd need more energy than is available in the universe

### 38m

if you want to accelerate even a modest amount of matter or mass to that speed and slow it down and then re-accelerate it back to the other side very, very fast. I think there are likely going to be physical limits, closed by the universe in terms of the energy, energy content of the universe, as to how fast something can be accelerated and slowed down and so on. There won't be a law of physics as such that says, look, you can't take, let's say Earth, right? Could we turn Earth into a spacecraft that we could accelerate to the speed of light, not to the speed of light, to arbitrarily close to the speed of light, and get anywhere, to the speed of light? I think the Borg cube does that out of Star Trek, right? It's the sort of thing that travels around at warp speed here and there, ignoring laws of physics. But let's say we didn't ignore the laws of physics. We said we're going to have something of equivalent size and mass to planet Earth,

### 39m

and we wanted to accelerate it from galaxy to galaxy, arbitrarily close to the speed of light. Even though there's no law of physics that says you can't do that, there might be quantities within the universe, such as the available energy in the universe, which is simply insufficient in order for you to fuel something like that, because you can calculate the amount of energy required to accelerate a mass, even with a perfect annihilation reaction, okay, pure energy. There just simply might not be enough energy in the universe to do that. So that's another issue. Not only is the laws of physics in the way, unless you regard that as a law of physics, a regularity of nature, as well as knowing how, even if we knew how, and even if there wasn't a law of physics in the way, maybe there's just not enough energy to do certain things. That takes me off on a tangent. Let's keep going. David says, quote, virtual reality and time travel have this at least in common. They both systematically alter the usual relationship between external reality and the user's experience of it.

### 40m

So one might ask this question. If a universal virtual reality generator could so easily be programmed to affect future directed time travel, is there a way of using it for past directed time travel? For instance, if slowing us down, would send us into the future, would speeding us up, send us into the past? No, the outside world would merely seem to slow down. Even at the unattainable limit where the brain operated infinitely fast, the outside world would appear frozen at a particular moment. That would still be time travel by the above definition, but it would not be past directed, end quote. So yes, this is the idea that if your brain is operating at the speed of light kind of thing, it's just, it's a similar sort of idea to photons getting everywhere instantly, which is a bit of a mind bending idea. So if you're getting everywhere instantly, you're just seeing everything frozen, nothing appeared. But of course, you experience nothing because you experience no travel time.

### 41m

One moment you're here, the next moment you're there. That's true teleportation, right? You're getting everywhere instantly. Even though for outside observers, you're never exceeding the speed of light. So of course, you're not traveling a fucking bit. The resolution, by the way, if you say, well, how can it be possible for a photon to experience getting from one side of the galaxy to another instantly traveling 120,000 light years? Isn't that a form of teleportation? It's not because the length is not 120,000 light years. The distance is not 120,000 light years according to the photon. It's zero. It's zero. Everything has been length contracted to zero. Another story. David goes on to say, quote, one might call it present directed. Time travel. I remember wishing for a machine capable of present directed time travel when doing last minute revision for exams. What student has not before I discuss past directed time travel itself. What about the rendering of past directed time travel? To what extent could a virtual reality generator be programmed to give the user the experience of past directed time travel?

### 42m

We shall see that the answer to this question, like all questions about the scope of virtual reality tells us about physical reality as well. The distinctive aspects of experiencing a past environment are, by definition, experiences of certain physical objects or processes, clocks and calendars in states that occurred only at past times, that is, in past snapshots. A virtual reality generator could, of course, render those objects in those states. For instance, it could give one the experience of living in the age of the dinosaurs or in the trenches of the First World War, and it could make constellations, dates on newspapers or whatever appear correctly for those times. How correctly? Is there any fundamental limit on how accurately any given era could be rendered? The Turing Principle says that a universal virtual reality generator can be built and could be programmed to render any physically possible environment, so clearly it could be programmed to render any environment that did once exist physically,

### 43m

end quote, pausing there, in principle. According to the Turing Principle, any environment that exists or has existed, or will exist, could be rendered, by a virtual reality generator. Now, in reality, if you wanted to produce a high fidelity rendering of the past, the issue you would have is who's going to input the information about the past, especially when some of that information is completely lost forever. So maybe there was a species of animal that existed on the planet, hundreds of millions of years ago, that has long since died, gone extinct, was never preserved in fossils, and its decay led to the loss of every remnant of it, including all of its DNA. Although that creature existed, there's no information left, no trace that we could ever hope to gather, because of the irrevocable march of decay and disorder,

### 44m

entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, just causing things to decay and information to be lost. So that's a possibility. That physical law may well stand in the way of reproducing any arbitrary past environment. Some of the information may simply be lost for good. As David goes on to say, quote, to render a time machine that had a certain repertoire of past destinations, and therefore also render the destinations themselves, the program would have to include historical records of the environments at those destinations. In fact, it would need more than mere records, because the experience of time travel would involve, more than merely seeing past events unfolding around one. Playing records of the past to the user would be mere image generation, not virtual reality. Since a real time traveler would participate in events and act back upon the past environment, an accurate virtual reality rendering of a time machine, as of any environment,

### 45m

must be interactive. The program would have to calculate for each action of the user, how the historical environment would have responded to that action. For example, to convince Dr. Johnson that a purported time machine, really had taken him to ancient Rome, we should have to allow him to do more than just watch passively and invisibly as Julius Caesar walked by. He would want to test the authenticity of his experiences by kicking the local rocks. He might kick Caesar, or at least address him in Latin, and expect him to reply in kind. What it means for a virtual reality rendering of a time machine to be accurate, is that the rendering should respond to such interactive tests, in the same way as would a real time machine, and as would the real past environments, to which it traveled. That should include, in this sense, displaying a correctly behaving, Latin speaking, rendering of Julius Caesar. Since Julius Caesar and ancient Rome were physical objects, they could in principle be rendered with arbitrary accuracy. Pausing there, my reflection. And of course, if this happens,

### 46m

what you have produced is AGI, and you've produced people, and the time machine effectively is a simulator of the real world, including, but, but it ceases, to be a simulation of a person. It would be a person. It would be Julius Caesar, not merely a simulation of Julius Caesar, or a rendering of Julius Caesar. If it acts for all the world like Julius Caesar, then it is a Julius Caesar. David goes on to say, quote, the task differs only in degree from that of rendering the center court at Wimbledon, including the spectators. Of course, the complexity of the requisite programs would be tremendous, more complex still, or perhaps even impossible in principle, would be the task of gathering the information required to write the programs to render specific human beings. End quote. Yes. And I was thinking not merely the task of rendering specific human beings would be perhaps impossible, even in principle. So it would be impossible,

### 47m

even in principle, to for any historic figure like Julius Caesar to render them arbitrarily well. In other words, to have a person who effectively is Julius Caesar. I think that might even be, closer to being possible than something like arbitrarily well rendering 120 million years ago, during the age of the dinosaurs, where only the tiniest fraction of a fossil record remains of the organisms that really existed back then. And the overwhelming majority of the complexity back then wasn't in the earth, or even the atmosphere, or whatever you like, which could be simulated arbitrarily well. But in the organisms and the diversity of species, and many of those species would be lost forever. They just do not appear in the fossil record. None of their DNA is left. There's no bones. There's nothing.

### 48m

And if there's nothing left, there's no way of simulating them, because there's no input to put into your virtual reality simulation. So if you want to travel into the past, using this particular method, or not exactly traveling into the past, but at least experiencing and interacting with a past time, using virtual reality in this way, that would seem to be impossible. But anyway, David does go on to say, quote, but writing the programs is not the issue here. I'm not asking whether we can find out enough about the past environment, or indeed about a present or future environment, to write a program that would render that environment specifically. I'm asking whether the set of all possible programs for virtual reality generators does or does not include one that gives a virtual reality rendering of past directed time travel, and if so, how accurate that rendering can be. If there were no programs rendering time travel, then the Turing principle would imply that every time travel was physically impossible,

### 49m

because it says that everything that is physically possible can be rendered by some program. And on the face of it, there is indeed a problem. Here, even though there are programs which accurately render past environments, there appear to be fundamental obstacles to using them to render time travel. These are the same obstacles that appear to prevent time travel itself, namely the so-called paradoxes of time travel, end quote. And on that, on those paradoxes of time travel, the so-called grandfather paradox, which everyone kind of knows, you know, you go back into the past and you kill your grandfather before, they have a chance to be a parent to your father, so therefore you were never born, to be able to go back in time to kill your grandfather, that kind of thing. On that, there's so much grist for the mill, there's so much to talk about, there's such a wide variety of things to explore, and exciting science fiction to talk about, that I will leave that for next episode. But if you're desperate for more about time travel,

### 50m

did you know that David Deutsch actually produced, wrote, starred in a documentary for the BBC? All about time travel. Link in the description, it's here, it's available on YouTube, it only has a few views, but it's a young David Deutsch talking about time machines and time travel, and basically the content of this particular chapter, and you could do far worse than watching that. Very entertaining still, holds up to this day, an excellent exploration of time travel, as envisaged by the quantum view of time, as applied to, and general relativity. But until next time, when you travel into the future, perhaps for you, only a few minutes, but for me, some considerable time. More than that, I will see you in the next episode about time travel. Till then, bye-bye.
