Welcome to TopCast, live I suppose. I did this yesterday so it's the second time I'm doing a live recording of TopCast and at the end we'll do some ask me anything questions. Hopefully I'm coming through loud and clear so people can let me know if in fact I cannot be heard or cannot be heard clearly. I've turned down the gain a little so we say because I don't know it sounded a bit to me when I listened back as if I was coming through a little too loudly perhaps. Today I'm reading from, rather than one of David Deutsch's works, this here. It is a book by Paul Davies, the great Paul Davies, who is possibly the modern day's most prolific science writer in terms of certainly physics, cosmology, that kind of thing. Inspirational books. In a different category I often say to the style of book and content of book that David Deutsch

### 1m

writes. I'm a fan of them both but for quite different reasons. On the one hand, Paul Davies began writing books back in the 70s and his books have continued similar themes over the years, kind of repackaging the same kind of content with, updated information about what we've learned about the cosmos and have learned about science. So in that sense it's almost like his works are an ongoing set of scientific news. And so I first read The Mind of God back when it was published in sort of 94-95. He received the Templeton Prize for that, which is a prize that is worth more monetarily than the Nobel Prize. It's got a religious bent. It tends to be awarded to, and the Templeton Foundation tends to support work that tends in the direction of the intersection between theology and science.

### 2m

Some people think that you've sold out if you accept a Templeton Prize grant. I think that's ridiculous, of course. Scientists should take whatever money they can from whatever source they can. The criticism is that if you get supported by the Templeton Foundation, then this colors your work in some way. I just don't think that's true. The Templeton Foundation comes to you, offering you support, and then doesn't place conditions upon, as far as I'm aware, what you do with the money. And anyway, the Templeton Prize, certainly, was awarded to Paul Davies, not on the basis of him doing research, but rather him writing a book. When you read The Mind of God, however, it's wonderful marketing. It's wonderful marketing. The word God only appears on books. It's about 13 or 14 pages, something like that. It's not like the work is really about the mind of God.

### 3m

When he uses the word God, he's speaking in the Einsteinian sense. Einstein didn't believe in God. He kind of used, sometimes, loose language in referring to things like the mind of God as a substitute or synonym for the laws of physics, reality as a whole, that kind of thing. And so, learning the mind of God. This means understanding the laws of physics in some way or other. So, after all, if God exists, then he has, or she has, it has determined what the laws of physics are. Okay. Well, at least a creator of God would have done that. So, let's begin with the reading. Now, I have a couple of copies of this, including one that's on the screen. So, I'm not going to be reading from the physical book. And I'm only going to read the one chapter. All of the chapters in this book, it's unique as far as Davies is concerned, because these are more like a... collection of articles, you know, like newspaper articles, reflecting on big questions in science.

### 4m

And so, I won't be reading them all by any stretch. I'll do a few of these episodes, I would say, because they're very interesting. They go into some of the more recent discoveries, especially in cosmology. This particular chapter I'm reading today is more about the history and science of the Big Bang, leading into our most recent understanding of... the origins of the universe. Davies was trained in cosmology. And indeed, one of his supervisors was Fred Hoyle. And he's going to mention Fred Hoyle here. Somewhat unfairly, when we get there, I might say more about this. But Fred Hoyle is often remembered popularly as that guy who refused to ever accept the Big Bang. Fred Hoyle was a great proponent of the steady state theory. Now, he was mistaken. Okay.

### 5m

He shouldn't be remembered for what he got wrong, but rather for what he got right. Because Fred Hoyle was, on the other hand, also, if not the greatest astrophysicist of the 20th century, he certainly deserves to be counted in the top ten, five, perhaps. Because he was the guy that explained stellar nucleosynthesis. He explained... He explained where the elements on the periodic table came from. That's huge. He explained how you get from hydrogen to everything else. The basic principles. He's the first one to sort of put that together. Yeah, of course, these things are collaborations. And he was drawing on the work of other people. But he was the guy. He was to how the sun produces the energy that it does as Einstein was to gravity. Fred Hoyle was huge in astrophysics. Sadly, in cosmology, which is related to astrophysics, but isn't really identical because not as identical. In cosmology, it was about the universe on the largest scales,

### 6m

what effect space-time has on the structure of the entire universe, is going evolve. The origins of the universe and the fate of the universe used to be in the domain of theology. And now it is becoming a precision science. Then you can measure stuff. with high-precision instruments, scientific instruments. And we'll talk about at least some of these today. Okay, so the Big Bang. Let's read this from What's Eating the Universe by Paul Davies, published just in 2021. As of me giving this episode of TalkCast, his most recent book. As I say, he's been writing books since the 70s. He's only slightly older than David Deutsch. I'm sure their paths have crossed multiple times. But, you know, I was a great fan of Davies, and it was because Davies appeared to be a great fan of Deutsch

### 7m

that I was led to David Deutsch. I've told that story many times as well. You know, the high praise that David Deutsch received from Paul Davies was more than enough persuasion for me. Okay, so what does Davies say about the Big Bang? This is Chapter 4 of the book. And these are self-contained chapters. There's also another wonderful thing about this book. You can just pick it up and read any particular chapter. So, you know, people interested in popular science, this is a great book for that. I guess he's writing it for the world we now live in, for people with shorter attention spans. As Naval says, people don't want the book, they want the blog post. And sometimes they don't want the blog post, they just want the tweet. And sometimes they don't want the tweet, just tell them now. So Davies has gone from huge epic books about the mind of God to a book about the mind of God. Down to discreet chapters that stand independently one from another. Okay, so let's go. He writes, Chapter 4, The Big Bang.

### 8m

In Flagstaff, Arizona, there is a famous observatory built in 1894 by a rich businessman, Percival Lowell. His plan was to use the telescopes to look for Martians. In the latter half of the 19th century, this wasn't considered totally off the wall. Scientists openly discussed the possibility that Mars was inhabited and astronomers searched eagerly for signs of life. In 1877, an astronomer, Giovanni Schiaparelli, said he could see straight lines or channels on the planet's surface. And this stuck to much speculation about the canals of Mars. Mars' fever was brilliantly captured in H.G. Wells' 1898 science fiction story, The War of the Worlds. Fixated by the notion of Martian engineers, Lowell embarked on his own observations, producing elaborate maps of what turned out to be an entirely fanciful network of canals. End quote. Okay.

### 9m

These canals that were on the surface of Mars, there's been attributed to a number of things, perhaps to Schiaparelli's imagination. They came purely from his imagination. Or perhaps they were artifacts on the telescope lens, to be generous to him, perhaps. And this is why we say observation is theory-laden. Observation is theory-laden. He was seeing canals that just weren't there. Or canals, canals. Why am I saying canals? Canals that just weren't there. So if your lens is scratched and you're looking at a distant object like Mars, it might very well appear that there are these channels, these rivers, these water-carrying bodies on the surface of Mars. Observation is theory-laden. What you see is not necessarily true. In fact, there was nothing on Mars, okay? So either it could have actually been entirely within his own mind, entirely.

### 10m

That's why we have such a thing as science, so we can check, we can check the observations of each other. All right, let's continue. Davies writes, while Lowell pursued his quixotic quest, rather more conventional astronomy was also being conducted at his observatory. By the late 19th century, telescopes had advanced to the point where they could probe far beyond the confines of our Milky Way Galaxy. A big issue of the day concerned the large-scale organisation of the cosmos. In particular, what were all those nebulae, wispy patches of light, seen scattered across the sky? Were they giant clouds located within our galaxy, or were they entire galaxies, in their own right, too far away for the individual stars to be discerned? End quote. Why didn't they know? Why didn't they know? Why didn't they know? know that the Andromeda galaxy, for example, you look at the Andromeda galaxy, it can be seen with the naked eye, it looks like a star. How could they not have known back then that it wasn't in

### 11m

our own galaxy? Well, because they had no method for figuring out the distance to very distant objects. When we want to determine the distance to a star, the first and indeed the only direct way, I use the word direct provisably, but I'll get to the reasons why in a moment, I say that this is a precise method where you can use an instrument, an instrument to determine the distance to the object, rather than making further assumptions. Okay, all observation is theory-laden. Let me, if you want to determine the distance to a star, then you can use this method called parallax. All right, so we've got this. Very, very, very, very distant objects appear to be fixed in the sky, no matter what position the Earth occupies around the Sun. However, as the Earth does go around the

### 12m

Sun, some of the closest stars appear to move, and the closest stars appear to move the most, and the more distant stars appear to move the least, until once you reach past about, for ground-based telescopes, something like 300, perhaps out to a thousand, light years at most, depending upon how powerful your telescope is. You do not notice these stars moving at all. Now, you can notice parallax yourself by simply putting your own finger in front of your face, and looking with one eye, and comparing the position of your finger to the background, then opening it and closing the other eye, and looking at the finger. You'll see the finger appears to move. That's called the parallax effect. Exactly the same thing happens when the Earth goes around the Sun. Closed stars appear to move relative to the background, and the degree by which they move can be measured. So, you're only making a measurement of that angle, and d equals 1 over p.

### 13m

Wonderfully simple equation. The distance in parsecs, and p, the parallax angle in arc seconds. This direct relationship, that's why I say direct measurement. So long as you can measure that angle using an instrument, okay, when I say instrument, what they're doing is, they have photographic plates, and they measure how far across the sky the thing moves, okay, so on and so forth. But that can tell you to high precision how far away these stars are, okay? What do you do for all the other stars? Well, here's what you can do. You can find that within your, let's call it a thousand light year radius, you can find some special stars. One group of special stars are called the Cepheid variable. Cepheid variables are, as the name would suggest, variable stars. They expand and contract, expand and contract, with a regular period, a regular period, a very regular period. That can

### 14m

be measured. You notice the luminosity of these things go up and down, the brightness goes up and down, up and down, up and down. There is a relationship between the period, how, you know, frequently the things are getting bright and dark, right? Now, you're talking the order of days, by the way, you know. Maybe it has a brightness to dimness sort of period of three days. So the actual period would be six days, okay? Going from bright to bright to bright, dim, dim, dim. There is a relationship between the period and the inherent luminosity, inherent brightness of these Cepheid variables. So if you've got one within the thousand light year limit of three days, you can see that the brightness of these Cepheid variables is parallel. You can measure the distance to it directly. And then you make a further assumption. The further assumption is all such Cepheid variables for which you have the capacity to see them out

### 15m

beyond the limit of a thousand light years have exactly the same properties as the Cepheid variables within a thousand light years, which you know the distance to. If you know the distance to the Cepheid variables, number one, and you know their apparent brightness, which you, know with a photomultiplier here on the ground on earth, how bright the thing appears in the sky, then you can determine what the inherent brightness much must be called the absolute magnitude or just the luminosity, how bright it really is compared to something like the sun. Okay. If you put it and the sun side by side, you would know they're the three things that are related, the distance to the object, the, how bright it appear in the sky at the moment and its inherent luminosity, how bright it is. It really is obviously a really bright thing inherently. It was genuinely really bright. If you were near it would appear very dim if it's very distant, but we have this relationship,

### 16m

this relationship between the what's called the apparent magnitude, how bright it appears, the absolute magnitude, which is standardized as how bright the thing would appear at 10 light years away and the distance. Okay. These three things are related. So if you have these good distance measurements, using parallax, then you can just make the further assumption that if you find a Cepheid variable elsewhere in the universe, certainly within the galaxy, that given apparent brightness, you measure the period. That's easy. Okay. You measure the period of the thing, and that will tell you what the inherent luminosity of it is. So once you've got those two things, the apparent brightness easy, you get that from earth measure the period that tells you the luminosity because of the period luminosity, and then you can determine the distance to that star. So now you've got what's called a standard candle. This thing in the universe that tells you when you find it in a distant galaxy, how far away

### 17m

that galaxy is, approximately speaking. And this is in fact, what is done. Cepheid variable is very good for this. And the standard candle that's used, especially in cosmology, trying to find the distance to very, very distant galaxies, because well, eventually you get to the point where you simply can't see the Cepheid variables in other galaxies. They're just too far away. Is a type Ia supernova. A type Ia supernova is a supernova with very predictable inherent luminosity. For these things, you have to do fancy physics calculations because what's going on is you've got a big star next to a small star. And the big star is sucking material from the small star. It's accreting. It's collecting that material from the small star. Eventually that big star goes beyond a certain limit. Speaker 1 of mass. And that certain limit of mass causes it to explode as a supernova. For reasons I won't get into the full astrophysics here, but there's a specific mass at which that happens. A specific

### 18m

mass at which that happens. Sorry, I got it around the wrong way. I just realized what am I talking about? It's the small star, often a white dwarf, often it's a white dwarf, that is accreting material from the big star. That's what's going on. This big star, as in big as in volume, also in mass perhaps. It is close to this white dwarf star and it is accreting material, accreting material, collecting material from this white dwarf star. Once the white dwarf star exceeds a certain limit, I think this is called the Chandrasekhar limit. I forget my limits. Yes, it is the Chandrasekhar limit. Once that limit is exceeded, then the star explodes. And all such white dwarfs explode at precisely the same mass. That's what's happening. How do you know you're seeing the same luminosity? In a universe producing exactly the same luminosity, the same brightness. This is a standard candle. Now if you see one of these things occur throughout the universe... By the way, all of these type 1A supernovae have precisely the same light curves. They're all different sorts of supernovae.

### 19m

How do you know you're seeing a type 1A supernova? How do you know you're seeing the one where it's the white dwarf accreting material from the other big star? Rather than some random star ending its life? How can you distinguish? plot the luminosity over time of these objects and there is a characteristic curve a specific way in which the the the light changes over time it reaches the maximum and then it falls back down again so uh that's how we can determine the distance to very distant galaxies because very distant galaxies they're going to have um it's going to be difficult to tell how far away they are unless you've got something very very bright and a supernova is extremely bright and predictable with its light curve so that's how we determine the distance to distant objects what davies is talking about here is a time when we didn't have these techniques

### 20m

we didn't know enough about astrophysics to know all this sort of stuff we knew we knew about parallax once you get beyond the thousand light year limit approximately you don't know how far away things are so you didn't know whether or not the andromeda galaxy was as it is 2.2 million light years away or merely within inside the inside the galaxy at a mere 20 000 light years away you couldn't distinguish between these two situations if there's anyone there listening just give me a sign that you can hear me otherwise i'm could be talking into the ether um let's continue uh davies goes on to write quote in 1909 a lowell observatory astronomer named vesto sliffer set about examining the quality of the light from the mysterious nebulae the only telescope

### 21m

he had was a relatively modest 24-inch instrument so this was slow painstaking repetitive work with no fancy electronic gizmos of the sort astronomers have today all observations had to be done by hand and eye often with on the fly improvisations to coax the best out of the equipment sliffer analyzed the faint nebulous glows with a device called a spectroscope designed to split light into its constituent colors he labored away night after night often freezing conditions recording the results on film in those days an astronomer's lot was not a happy one yet the compulsion that drives the slippers of this world is that dedicated toil in some small corner of a subject can unexpectedly strike gold and that's just what happened that's just what happened at lowell observatory by 1912 sliffer had assembled enough data to conclude that most nebulae were measurably redder in the color measurably redder in color than the milky way

### 22m

why was that an explanation was immediately apparent when a light source is receding at great speed the emitted light waves are stretched shifting the wavelength towards the red end of the color spectrum therefore concluded that most nebulae are rushing away from us uh end quote so um yes slipher made this big advance and davis was about to say that however However although he was the first one to notice these things moving away from us he didn't know there were galaxies he didn't know there were galaxies and so that's that's why he isn't given the credit that hubble was later on but a lot of people make a big deal about this it's like oh sliffer deserves the credit for actually figuring out that the universe was expanding knew no he didn't no no he did figure out that these things had redshift had large redshift

### 23m

and they're rushing away from us but he didn't he couldn't solve the mystery so vesto sliffer did make these excellent observations but he didn't know what they meant so he couldn't explain them this is an important distinction to make okay so in terms of the history let's keep going davies goes on to say with hindsight we can see that 1912 marked the true birth of modern cosmology but there was no fanfare no press conference just a careful technical paper buried in the observatory's bulletin end quote well yes and no but like why would people have fanfare about this it was a problem it was a mystery no one knew again if they had if sliffer had have said hey look i know that the higher redshift means they're further away that would have been something but he didn't he didn't know that so all he knew was that well he made this measurement and made this measurement that um

### 24m

that all of these objects had redshift okay davies goes on to say it took several years and many more observations because before he could do anything he could do anything sliffer's discovery gained prominence eventually coming to the attention of a certain edwin hubble a lawyer turned astronomer rarely seen without a pipe in 1924 hubble used the big 100 inch telescope at mount wilson in california then the world's largest to measure the distance to the andromeda galaxy andromeda nebula the nebula by managing to detect individual stars and in doing so proved that andromeda is in fact going to work and is going to come into our lives for the rest of our lives another entire galaxy like the milky way end quote yes so at the time when slither did this it was the andromeda nebula not the andromeda galaxy but he was able to with his with this huge telescope 100 inch telescope discern individual stars and therefore if you could

### 25m

discern individual stars then well this was a thing that was um uh not within our galaxy and if he can see cepheid variables he can determine precisely the distance to this galaxy which is eventually done hubble went on to estimate the distances to another 23 galaxies then he combined his results with slipper's redshift measurements and glimpsed the outline of something systematic you the farther away the galaxy was located the redder its light and the faster its recession it seemed to be in proportion the simplest interpretation of this pattern was that the universe was gradually expanding growing larger over a time scale of billions of years end quote yes so this can be summed up this result is summed up in four words the further the faster the further the faster so the further away a galaxy is the faster it's moving away

### 26m

from us so you go ah what's special about us why are we you know um why is everything moving away from us well it's not it wouldn't matter what galaxy you're in you would notice every galaxy moving away from you because the entire universe is expanding space itself is growing in between these galaxies but not all the galaxies some like the andromeda galaxy in particular is actually moving towards us because they're gravitationally bound gravity when objects are close together is more powerful for the time being then the tendency of space to expand so it can locally stop the expansion of space after all space is not expanding where you are or where i am i'm not growing taller we are not getting further apart uh the intermolecular bonds of my body are keeping me together the expansion of space doesn't make any difference but possibly more importantly locally here this space is being held together by something like the earth okay the curvature of space is preventing it from

### 27m

uh growing okay so hubble has just found this further the faster proportionality this wonderful straight line that one can draw between uh red shifts and distances this uh this relationship and davies goes on to say quote hubble duly announced his results to the world in the new york times on 23rd of november 1924 it was undoubtedly one of the most important results of the world's history and it was one of momentous discoveries of the 20th century and plaudits were soon showered upon the pope's mic pope and plaudits were soon showered upon the pipe smoking astronomer leaving vesto sliffer as the unsung hero of the expanding universe end quote yes but again again we have to say what he did impressive though it was was to provide the problem not the solution okay yes it's important

### 28m

for scientists to come up with problems but it's also important for scientists to come up with problems every solution reveals a new problem okay you know um uh he he wondered what these things were these nebulae in the sky vesto sliffer and he by looking encountered another problem this often happens in in astronomy you point your telescope somewhere and you find things that you don't understand you encounter more problems the invention of the telescope solves a lot of stuff how to see things that previously could not be seen but then it opens up a world of problems like why do they all have redshift what are these things that have redshift all of them problem solution hubble saying that these objects are actually outside of our galaxy and relationship the further away they are the faster they're moving problem why well expansion of space expansion of space

### 29m

um davis goes on to say quote with the realization that the universe isn't just there an unchanging collection of glowing oddments but is a dynamic system evolving with time a host of questions arose about its trajectory where had this system come from and where was it heading what determines how fast the universe is expanding could the expansion rate change with time and how fast the universe is expanding could the expansion rate change with time could the universe is expanding could the expansion rate change with time when did it begin and will it go on forever two implications of the expansion were immediately obvious first if the expansion is getting bigger it must previously have been smaller and denser second the effect on gravity a universal attractive force would act like a break on the expansion slowing the recession of the galaxies as they pulled on each other because of this deceleration the expansion must have been faster in the past hubble's observations weren't extensive or accurate enough

### 30m

to detect any change in the rate of expansion over the few million years that they encompassed however the breaking effect of gravity was easy enough to study theoretically and as early as 1921 the russian astronomer alexander friedman had calculated precisely how the expansion rate would gradually slow but his deliberations were mostly ignored astronomers were flirting with one of the most far-reaching discoveries in the history of science but such was the tentative nature of these early results that no leading scientist was prepared to take the plunge and state the obvious implication end quote yes so the obvious implication was that the universe in the past was smaller and keep on going back in the past everything was on top of everything else eventually there was time when the universe had zero size if you could extrapolate back like that

### 31m

this then becomes a problem it suggests the universe had an origin in time which seems to be a creation event that's a problem after all what caused this creation event who solved this who solved this this problem i was willing to state it this. Well, Davies goes on to say, in the event it fell to a young Belgian priest and theoretical physicist, Abay Georges Lemaitre, to come out and claim explicitly in 1927 that the universe we now observe must have begun billions of years ago as a cosmic egg, a state of enormous density that expanded with explosive force. This was the precursor to the modern Big Bang theory.

### 32m

You might have expected that a declaration of such profound importance would be a scientific, not to mention theological, sensation. Yet again, however, the response was muted. Hubble himself doubted Lemaitre's conclusion. Albert Einstein, by then the world's greatest authority on gravitation and cosmology, was equally dismissive. Your calculations are correct, he wrote to Lemaitre, but your physics is atrocious. Einstein had also shrugged Friedman's earlier theoretical effort aside. And indeed, he only accepted that the universe was actually expanding after visiting Hubble in California in 1931. After that, he did a U-turn and backed Lemaitre's work. In spite of this illustrious endorsement, speculation about the origin of the universe wasn't taken very seriously in the 1930s. Indeed, cosmology was hardly even a recognized subject.

### 33m

I'd also be quite surprised if Einstein were to be79 years younger now. So long as heritage matters. Do physics have the same consequences as innor 성공 in the 1960s? University of New York é št Muss ste' general relativity predicted space was not entirely stable and so the thing should have been contracting or expanding uh the sitters kind of said well the universe should be expanding because if it was contracting we would have noticed um you know it depends on how much mass there is in the universe which is the difficult thing to estimate as to whether or not you have contraction after a while so anyway einstein

### 34m

should have just stuck with his own theory and said well what does the theory say if the theory says that space expands or contracts as a whole then that's what it does and then you go out and you um see what the observations tell them and in fact of course you know we know now hubble's observations show that the universe is indeed expanding the space is expanding okay let's go on davy says quote happily the theoretical work of friedman and lamartre wasn't gotten though it took another two decades before it was revivified by george gamow a defector from the soviet union working in the united states gap now wasn't an astronomer he was a nuclear physicist it was he who explained the type of radioactivity known as the alpha decay gamow reasoned that the young highly compressed universe must have been hot enough to prevent

### 35m

nuclear reactions consequently it would have glowed like a furnace which raised a fascinating possibility might a fading remnant of that primordial heat still pervade the universe today forming a cosmic background of microwave radiation end quote yeah wonderful okay so explained alpha decay this is where you have heavy nuclei releasing what is essentially a helium nucleus you know two protons and two neutrons he2 plus uh they come firing out of the nucleus this is the in one sense the least penetrating kind of radiation so the least dangerous as long as it's outside of your body you're safe from it it's alpha radiation there's beta radiation which is a stream of electrons that's more energetic more dangerous and then there's gamma radiation the most energetic of all photons of light at exceedingly high frequency which is the worst of all

### 36m

a nuclear bomb will produce all of these things all these kinds of radiation uh there's a sense in which you know although alpha radiation is the least dangerous you know as long as you know you could be in a room of alpha radiation sources and you're reasonably safe in a way that if you're in a room with gamma radiation sources or beta radiation sources you're not but if the alpha radiation gets inside you then you're in sorts of trouble you know this is a famous case of polonium poisoning by the russian government of certain people over time they like to use polonium because it's an alpha emitter and it can quickly disappear but if it gets in you you know sprinkle a little bit of stuff on your food uh an awful way to die but a very effective means of assassinating someone uh so not good uh okay so could we have seen the heat left over from the big bang this is what gamma

### 37m

was postulating well yes okay and so here we get to the discovery of the so-called cmd cosmic microwave background davies goes on to write quote gamma was on the right track in 1964 two scientists working on satellite communications at the bell laboratory in new jersey accidentally came across his remnant heat bathing the universe at a temperature of about 2.7 degrees above absolute zero absolute zero is about minus 273 degrees it showed up as annoying as an annoying hiss in their receiver all attempts to explain it away as a defect in the equipment including pigeon droppings in the air and in the air and in the air and in the air and in the air and in the air and the antenna failed yes now um and this was called a um a white dielectric substance

### 38m

the pigeon droppings they spent days trying to clean their big antenna of pigeon droppings because they thought that that was where the interference was coming from no they detected the heat left over from the big bang davies goes on to say and the only explanation left was that disturbance came from outer space this was the big bang smoking gun if memory serves the story was that uh these two guys who were awarded the nobel prize for this by the way uh it just happened to be overheard uh at coffee one day in a cafe by another physicist who said that this was precisely the thing that george gamow had postulated you know that they were looking for this heat left over from the big bang droppings and they were looking for this heat left over from the big bang droppings and they were looking for this heat left over from the big bang but these guys not being uh astrophysicists didn't know about it um penzias and wilson was their

### 39m

name uh arno penzias and some wilson they discovered the cmb they were the first guys to point a instrument at the sky and detect in all directions this 2.7 kelvin temperature so that empty space was not completely empty so that empty space was not completely empty completely devoid of energy but contained heat what heat the heat left over from the big bang but after 13.8 billion years it had cooled to this obviously started hot but now spread throughout this vast volume of space and stretched also by the way that therefore you have um such a cool temperature now but it would have been very hot in the past in the very distant past so that after having said he's we're found the big bang smoking gun davis says quote suddenly

### 40m

cosmology was propelled into the scientific mainstream and began to attract some of the brightest minds in physics and mathematics the likes of roger penrose and stephen hawking the origin of the universe you know big bang was at least was at last taken seriously and became the focus of intense theoretical analysis astronomers began to clamor for better observations of the cosmic microwave background today referred to simply as the cmb confident that it contained crucial clues about the early universe because of atmospheric absorption a decent view of the cmb needs a satellite and that's what they got in november 1989 nasa launched kobe and with it cosmology's golden age end quote end of the chapter as well um yeah the kobe was what got a fellow called george smoot the nobel prize george smoot had a fairly large

### 41m

team uh they launched the cosmic microwave background explorer the satellite that took highly precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background that revealed that it wasn't exactly 2.7 kelvin in all directions because that was a problem solution problem solution problem the problem was if the cosmic microwave background was uniform in all directions exactly the same in all directions that meant the beginning of the universe was uniform everywhere the the the early universe would have been just as uniform as the heat left over by it so therefore why isn't the universe uniform after all here's a planet earth there's a sun here's a galaxy and it doesn't look uniform it looks inhomogeneous heterogeneous there are galaxies here and there are not galaxies there that's in in homogeneity it's not uniform

### 42m

so anyway they pointed their satellite at space you know this satellite which was able to take which detect microwaves uh it's very uh these long wavelength waves and measure it precisely and produce a map of the sky and you get what are called anisotropies it's something's called anisotropic it's the same all direction if it's anisotropic it's not the same in all directions so they found that it wasn't the same in all directions you know if you go down not to the first decimal place 2.7 but you go down to like the fourth or fifth decimal place okay um 2.701 in this direction 2.702 in this direction um so that kind of thing and so that's how they they figured out that you know the the early universe wasn't uniform either and hence that's the universe now is not uniform and why wouldn't the early universe have been uniform well because you've got quantum effects happening then when the universe was really small these quantum effects

### 43m

mean you can't have perfect uniformity you have fluctuations in everything including the amount of energy in different areas different regions of space especially when the the universe itself is smaller than an atom quantum effects then dominate so we should expect uh anisotropies in homogeneity yeah now this was um george smoot was the guy as i said and his student was charlie lineweaver another one of my intellectual heroes also happened to be a lecturer of mine he was the guy that processed the data charlie line with who i've mentioned on top cast many times before well worth looking up charlie lineweaver and going to his web pages he's a very engaging speaker and more than that his of research stretches across all of physics especially cosmology but you know if you're

### 44m

into aliens and that kind of stuff he is he's the guy who looks into astrobiology and that kind of thing just very interesting areas of research uh lesser known i think he should be more well known than he is uh and also has worked with paul davis and you know he's been doing a lot of great stuff for us um you know the feather in my cap is i always say i was the one who introduced them because i saw davies at an event science event went up to him because i was a starstruck student he was a hero of mine wanted his autograph you know he was very polite and asked me what i did i said i was going to study physics the university of new south wales charlie lineweaver is one of my lecturers and he said oh you know charlie lineweaver so i said yes i did and so um he gave me his card and i introduced him to charlie and then they went on to author papers together um and so now i think they still you know they do they collaborate they probably would have collaborated anyway regardless of whether or not i'd have been

### 45m

involved there like a catalyst um so there are a couple of other things just to read here um because in this chapter davies has two boxes two boxes of additional information so let me read the boxes of additional information then i'm going to go the questions for anyone who has me has questions for me and the boxes of information are firstly the first one is titled hubble wars davies writes quote the rate of expansion of the universe is expressed as a number known as the hubble constant or h the man himself assigned h a value of 500 in the peculiar system of units that astronomers prefer that means a galaxy about 3.3 million light years away is receding on average 500 kilometers per second given h and factoring in the breaking effect of gravity you can work out the age of the universe hubble's original value put the universe at only about 2 billion years old

### 46m

less than half the age of the earth astronomers lifted their game and produced estimates of h that progressively pushed back at the inferred age but they were divided into two warring factions one touted a value of 180 for h and the other one was 55 using the same methods and each insisting that the errors in measurement were far too small to be true so i'm going to go through the the discrepancy was an important issue because the smaller the number the greater the age of the universe in the 1980s data from the hubble space telescope put paid to the angst h finally came out at 73 a nice compromise making the universe 13.8 billion years old by current estimates but recently a new discrepancy has surfaced measurements of h using cosmic microwave background data yield a value of only 67 implying an age for the universe of well over 14 billion years does this suggest something seriously missed with our understanding of basic cosmology time will tell end quote so my thoughts on that yeah this is another interesting problem kobe was

### 47m

the first satellite to go up there and to produce a map of the universe then there was w map the so called wilkinson microwave and isotropy probe which got even more detailed refined accurate precise measurement i should say precise not accurate measurements of the cosmic microwave and recently we've had the plank observatory as well another satellite in space that takes even more high resolution images of cosmic microwave background okay when you look at these patches of light you know it looks like a strange pattern you can look up the plank data for the cosmic microwave background what they do is look at the size of these patches and the size of these patches tells them something about the expansion rate of the universe and it tells them something about um the age of the universe uh i think that is a less precise way of doing things so i would

### 48m

expect the error there you know spot what they say to be greater than the error using um the hubble technique of the redshift of galaxies using the original hubble technique but you know there are big errors in all of this stuff one of the other you know i've had and certainly real astronomers have is i was talking about type 1a supernovas earlier on these type 1a supernovas are assumed throughout the universe to have the same luminosity no matter where they go off and this is based on you know uh computer simulations but the computer simulations are only as good as the data you feed into them with the laws of physics that you have and the initial conditions you have and so on and so forth but who knows if these distant supernova type 1a made of different stuff because the universe very far

### 49m

away in the very early parts of the universe consisted of slightly different chemicals it took a while for you know astrophysics to produce different kinds of chemicals and i don't think we have a we have a good understanding but a good enough understanding to really think that you know all of these ways of predicting what should happen in the supernova given what the star is made out of unnecessarily going to be equally accurate let's say maybe a type 1a supernova that occurs in the andromeda galaxy made of andromeda galaxy stuff maybe we have a good understanding of that but put the same kind of supernova in a galaxy three billion light years away the chemistry is subtly different does that subtle difference make a difference to type 1a supernova i don't know but hypothesis apparently they rule these

### 50m

things out and i'm not entirely convinced so yeah at the moment there are good reasons to think that we should expect different estimates for um the hubble constant and therefore the rate of the expression the inverse in the universe is also a good reason to think that we should expect the and therefore the age of the universe as well but i always say 13.8 until such time as we have you know the textbook writers agreeing that the number needs to be updated the second box i'm going to read is just a brief one um and well just go through davis's quote did the bang big bang really happen not all astronomers accepted the link between the cosmic expansion and an explosive origin ironically the familiar moniker big bang was initially coined by the british astronomer fred hoyle in 1949 while dismissing the idea end quote yeah he was on a

### 51m

radio show i think on the bbc and you know he dismissed it as that silly big bang idea and so the name stuck ironically the guy who was an opponent of it named it anyway i mean davies goes on to say of hoyle hoyle thought lamar is going to do it in the future if i'm wrong but i wanted to make it clear that the theory of the universe was actually created by the universe it was created by the universe the universe was not created by the universe it was created by the universe and it's a completely different interpretation of hubble's observations called the steady state theory the basic idea is that as the universe expands the galaxies move apart so new matter is continually created gradually aggregating into fresh galaxies to fill the ever-growing gaps as a result on a very large scale the universe would look much the same forever there would be no beginning, no end, no hot dense primordial state. Hoyle fought fiercely for his theory, marshalling a band of loyal supporters. For about 20 years the two theories rivaled each

### 52m

other for support but then the knockout blow came. The discovery of the CMB had no credible explanation within the steady state model and support for it rapidly dwindled. I went to work with Hoyle in Cambridge at this critical juncture. He was this world-famous astronomer and public celebrity, known for his science fiction novels as well as his research, strangely isolated, casting around for some way to rescue the essence of his theory, perhaps by treating the Big Bang as an interlude rather than an absolute origin. He gave up on the idea that particles of matter were continually created in a thin soup throughout space in favour of concentrated creation centres. In the 1960s highly compact objects called quasars were discovered that fling out huge quantities of energy into the atmosphere. They were then used as a source of energy for material. Hoyle believed these energetic sources were cosmic spigots pouring brand new matter into the universe. But the simplicity of the original steady state concept was lost and in 1972 Hoyle resigned his chair at Cambridge in disillusionment and became something of a recluse, tucked away in

### 53m

a remote cottage in Cumbria where he filled his days fell walking, sniping at scientific establishment. But remember he is a hero in astrophysics. He was the guy that explained stellar nuclear synthesis. How? The elements are produced. And by the way the steady state theory also couldn't explain the ratio of hydrogen to helium to all the other elements. The fact that around about 75 74 75 percent of by mass of the universe is hydrogen and 24 percent is helium and you know one percent or less is the rest of the stuff is explained by the Big Bang. It's explained by the Big Bang theory. And the dark night sky is explained by the Big Bang theory. It's the resolution of Olber's paradox. If you had the steady states and this infinite universe was around forever how do you get around a super bright night sky? I don't think there's an answer to that in steady state. There's hedges and there's attempts to

### 54m

work around it. But the best explanation, the best explanation is the Big Bang because it answers all those things. It explains why there's a dark night sky. It explains the Hubble expansion. It explains the nucleosynthesis. Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The ratio of hydrogen to helium. And it explains the CMB, the cosmic background heat. So that's that. And that is the end of the reading. Good hour there on Paul Davies. What's eating the universe? Now I have questions that I neglected to answer from last time from Twitter. The first of which is from Tybalt. I did answer his question last time but he clarified on Twitter

### 55m

and I may have misunderstood what he was saying. So he was saying why is the reach of a theory, scientific theory, determined by its hard-to-vary characteristics? And I said it's not. These are independent things. What makes a theory a good explanation is its hard-to-varyness. But I use the example of my cat. It can be a good explanation that my cat is in the other room right now. It can be a good explanation that I'm drinking some water. These are good explanations with zero reach. But they're hard-to-vary. Very exceedingly hard-to-vary. The cat, there's no other place for the cat to be. This transparent liquid substance here that isn't killing me when I take a sip is hard-to-vary from

### 56m

the fact that it's water. The explanation is water. So no reach. But hard-to-vary. On the other hand, any claim that's universal has potentially infinite reach out to the far reaches of the universe. Newtonian gravity is the universal law of gravitation. Once you say that it applies here on Earth, it's the law of gravity. Gravity exists anywhere there's mass. It suddenly applies throughout the entire universe. Reach. Reach. Okay. But Tybalt has come back with clarification. He said he was referring specifically to a particular extract. So I'm going to read it. Okay. So I'm going to read it. I'm just going to read the extract that he provided to me where he's firstly he's quoted. He said he's referring to particularly where David says the better an explanation is, the more rigidly its reach is determined. Okay. Rigidly the reach is determined. So it's hard-to-vary its reach when you have a good explanation. Quite right. So the fact that you're hard-to-vary makes all parts of the theory hard-to-vary.

### 57m

Every aspect of the theory becomes hard-to-vary. What it says exists, what it predicts, what its reach is, what it explains about reality, all of that stuff becomes hard-to-vary. Okay. But let's read this. David wrote, quote, it is determined by the content of the explanation itself. The better an explanation is, the more rigidly its reach is determined because the harder it is to vary an explanation. The harder it is, in particular, to construct a variant with a different reach, whether larger or smaller, that is still an explanation. He goes on to say, we expect the law of gravity to be the same on Mars as on Earth, because only one viable explanation of gravity is known, Einstein's general theory of relativity. And that is a universal theory. But we did not expect the map of Mars to resemble the map of Earth, because our theories about how Earth looks, despite being

### 58m

excellent explanations, have no reach to the appearance of any other astronomical object. So David's saying there, the effect upon the reach, given how hard-to-vary the theory is. I can assert any old theory right now that has reach, universal reach throughout the universe. Okay. In space-time, there exists infinite fairies. And these fairies observe the cosmos. They don't interact by any physical force, and they can't be detected through gravity or light or anything else. They cannot be detected. But they're absolutely crucial for consciousness and the capacity of consciousness to give rise to everything in the universe. This is the purpose of fairies.

### 59m

Okay. Okay. Okay. And there's infinite of them. Now, that theory is a theory with vast reach. It reaches everywhere in space, but also it reaches into everything, every consciousness and everything that exists. How do things come into being? You think of them, and the fairies that exist everywhere bring those things into being. Ridiculous theory. Why? Because easy-to-vary, bad explanation. Why fairies are not... What are the properties of these fairies? I can't test for these fairies. I've just, out of whole cloth, invented fairies. I could have said elves. I could have said dragons. I could have said enzymes. It doesn't matter. The word fairy is serving no purpose here, and indeed, the theory is serving no purpose. It's not explaining anything. It's providing more problems than it solves.

### 1h 0m

But this is the kind of theory that you get, by the way. There's certain versions of the anthropic principle and so on. There's certain ways of thinking about quantum theory, incorrect ways, misconceived ways, that consciousness bring the reality into existence. I've just added fairies to it, trying to provide a mechanism. They don't provide a mechanism. But there you go. So that's reach, but easy-to-vary. All right. So there's one situation. But here's another. Okay. Space is filled with vacuum energy at all points, and it acts to accelerate the expansion of space. Okay. That's a theory. That's also testable. It has reach everywhere throughout space, but nowhere into consciousness. It's not like... It's only confined to effects on space-time.

### 1h 1m

This, by the way, is one explanation. Not great. But it is offered as explaining the accelerating expansion of the universe, the dark energy. It could be a form of vacuum energy. But the calculations don't work out. Okay. So it's a problem. But there is this vacuum energy, right? There is this vacuum energy that exists in otherwise empty space, because, you know, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says that, you know, you're looking at a very small region of space. Okay. Then within a certain time, you're not certain about what the energy is. And the energy can come in to that part of space. There's a non... You can never be sure that in the region of space you're looking at, you're going to have zero energy. So all of space is permeated with some non-zero amount of energy, because of quantum theory. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. So there it is.

### 1h 2m

Okay. So this might have the effect of accelerating the expansion of space. But it doesn't have anything to do. That's got infinite reach. It's harder to vary than certainly my original fairy idea. But its reach is limited. Its reach is limited by the fact that it is talking about specific things, about space and energy. It's not talking about consciousness, for example, or how stars shine, let's say. Okay. So maybe that makes things clearer? I hope. Well, we'll see. Someone else asked. Oh, yeah. I posted a thing where Jordan Peterson appeared on a Fox News program with a fellow called Tucker Carlson.

### 1h 3m

And I quoted Jordan Peterson after I listened to what he was saying. Okay. He was talking about his ideas, his very Jungian ideas, that everything's a story. We've got narratives. It's a good way of looking at the Bible and how the Bible was constructed. I think he does well on that kind of thing. These narratives contain deep messages about truth, about how societies work, let's say, and how morals work and how relationships work. The Bible tries to get some of that across using stories. But Jordan said, you know, everything. Everything's a story. Everything we know is a story. It's all a story. It's all this great story. In fact, quote from Jordan Peterson, he said, even our object-level perceptions are micro-stories. Our object perceptions are micro-stories, end quote.

### 1h 4m

I said, this may be taking story a little far, as if that's the case, then those stories are highly inexplicit, which would be a strange story to tell. Namely, a story that's not true. It's not true. It's a story we don't know. In other words, perception, raw perception is the thing that we try to explain, but we can't explain all of it. The very act of perception and consciousness is something we know we have, but we can't provide an explanation of it yet. We don't know how to describe what it's like to see red, for example, or to see the blue sky. What does the blue sky look like to you? You just have to say it's blue. Well, what does your blue look like? Can you convey that to me? No, we can't. We don't know how to describe our qualia, as we say. We use these words, but I don't know if my blue is the same as your blue and your red is the same as my red. You know, kids in high school figure this stuff out and their minds are blown. Most people's minds are blown when they first encounter this idea, this concept.

### 1h 5m

But no matter how long your life goes on, it appears as though you don't get any resolution to this particular question. How do we know that we're perceiving the world in the same way? To some extent, we know we aren't. We're in a different place and space, for one thing. But also, we've probably got different receptors in our eyes, slightly different. So my blues might appear different to your blues. But how different? How different? I don't know. No way to communicate this. No way to experience what someone else is experiencing. So if that's a story, it's a highly inexplicable what I'm saying. It's a story told not using words. So I don't think everything's a story. And I think this is related to this idea that I was speaking about yesterday where the author I was talking about was trying to say everything's fiction. When you draw a picture of a dinosaur, it's a fiction. But if a picture of a dinosaur is a fiction and a picture of a dragon is a fiction, what do we say about the distinction between those two things?

### 1h 6m

Because they're both not entirely the same kind of fiction. One's purely of the imagination and the other one is constrained by evidence. But they're in the same way. If everything's a story, well, how do we distinguish between stories of fiction and stories about fact? We need to be able to have a more fine-grained, higher resolution understanding of these particular concepts. Casting everything as a story can be misleading. It suggests that there's a subjectivity to a whole bunch of things in reality. But there's not. There's subjectivity when it comes to fiction and myth and so on. There's an easy-to-vary-ness about that that isn't the same when it comes to giving an account of physical reality. So that's one thing. Okay. Now, someone has asked me upon saying that. William has asked, but where would you categorize the story of Newton sitting under a tree?

### 1h 7m

Is it perception or a story? Okay. So that is certainly a story. And many think that it wasn't true. In fact, that's not how he came up with gravity. We know that he was working on specific problems to do with celestial dynamics. We know that he was considering the work of Kepler and others and trying to figure out the mathematical relationship of gravity. He wasn't just looking at apples falling from apple trees. So that's just a story that's possibly apocryphal. In other words, false. He was able to explain why, eventually. Apples fell to the ground. And not only that, but predict. Using his law. At what rate they would fall to the ground. Okay. Moving on. Someone has provided me with a thread and asked me for my take on the thread. And I haven't got that.

### 1h 8m

So let me read. It's about the AI thing. Sort of. But I might not know. But I might not mention the AI thing because there's something else that the person has asked. A fellow called Arthur has said, quote, For the longest time I found it weird. Yudkowsky would focus on spreading good epistemology as an instrument, as an instrumental goal towards reducing AI risk. The connection felt so remote. And the idea was that this needed, this was needed so dire. This need was so dire. After recent online arguments on the topic. Oh, shit. So this is. That's talking about Yudkowsky. And he apparently used to spread good epistemology. I'll look. You know, he has a version of rationality, which I think is very similar to Pinker's. And I don't think it's correct. I don't think it is good epistemology. It's epistemology. It's better than nonsense.

### 1h 9m

But, you know, he's a Bayesian through and through. Um. And Yudkowsky, like so many Bayesians, they become prophets. They think they have confidence in the future. And they think they can calculate their way to a future. They never understand that you cannot predict the growth of knowledge. You can't. You just can't do it. But they don't take these ideas seriously. And so because they don't, they predict seeing all problems without the solutions and fall into pessimism. Well, there we go. Okay. But anyway, someone has responded to this. Brendan has responded to that tweet saying, what's the TLDR, too long didn't read, on what convinced you of the strong connection rather than the remote connection? And Arthur has responded, the number of times people bring up popper, two or three messages in the conversation. And then he goes on to say, we figure things out by building models.

### 1h 10m

We figure things out by building models of the world, confronting them, confronting, conforming them, I suppose. But he said, oh, no, confronting them to reality and refining them as we go. Popper tried to formalize this properly but failed. And educated people sometimes use his takes to argue silly things. End quote. Okay. So there's a few problems there. One, this building of models or explanations, which then confront the world, reality, is precisely the thing that Popper explained. This was the thing. This was conjecture and refutation. He's just saying conjecture and refutation using different words. Conjecture, building a model of the world, confronting them to reality and refining them as we go. Refutation or attempt to refutation. So that is Popper. Popper tried to formalize this properly and failed. What does formalize mean? He certainly didn't try and mathematize it. He just explained this is the way knowledge creation works.

### 1h 11m

Educated people sometimes use his takes to argue silly things. I don't know who these are. Maybe David Deutsch has finally gained so much fame that, you know, because he's the only one out there. I don't see anyone else arguing about, I say arguing, discussing the issue of AGI and invoking Popper. And even then, I don't think he invokes his name very often. He just explains epistemology in the Purpurean sense. And maybe he's being cast as one of these experts. Cast as one of these educated people. But he's a unicorn. As far as I can tell. Exceedingly rare person. You don't see other David Deutsch's out there. I don't see people invoking Popper. I do. Naval does. David does. There's a few of us now that talk about conjectural knowledge and how one is not entitled to be confident about doomsday prophecies.

### 1h 12m

Of anything. But not least, not least when it comes to things like AGI and AI. So yeah, that's an issue. One more question. One more question comes from YouTube. That's from John Julius Jamora. And he's asked, what's your thoughts on difference between education and indoctrination? Where truth, being rational, objective, are getting blurred and always redefined. Mostly for their own personal biases. End quote. Yep. Okay. So that's the question. All education in the modern sense is indoctrination. That doesn't mean that it's useless. But it does mean that children are required to learn particular lessons and tested upon them. So that's indoctrination. There's pass and fail.

### 1h 13m

Genuine education would be where a student is allowed to choose what they want to learn at all times. Everyone wants to learn to talk and so they do. They want to communicate. These days, everyone wants to learn to type and read because you need it in order to understand what's happening on the screens that you are using every day. Many students, many people growing up now want to learn to code so they can literally build stuff using that device. They can hold in their hands the phone or the computer. So this is all going on. But school is still there, you know, moving at the glacial pace. Truth, being rational and objective, are getting blurred and always redefined. Yeah. In education, yeah, of course, they're still teaching by the old tropes.

### 1h 14m

We're giving you the truth. We're being rational. We're being objective. Yes. I agree. Yeah. So this is the problem with modern education and with especially tertiary education in particular. These incorrect ways of understanding how critical thinking works, how philosophy works, how knowledge is generated. And so they fall back on not quite ancient but certainly classical ideas about knowledge. They haven't been updated with Popper and Deutsch, which goes back to that, you know, previous person who was sort of having a swipe at Popper and saying that, you know, he failed. He tried to formalize this properly but failed. People never engage with Popper. They just cast stones. All they do is they insult him without ever quoting the man in his own words. Where did he try and formalize this properly? How did he fail? No, it's just an assertion. This is the quality. This is the quality of criticism that you get online against Popper. It's a shame.

### 1h 15m

It's a shame. I've just noticed that just very recently in the last few minutes, a fellow called Roshan Ali on Twitter has asked me. He's written a series of tweets. I'll read the series of tweets and I'll answer this and that will be it for today. But the series of tweets are, any exam or test whose answers are known and fixed, AI will do faster and better as it improves than people. It's the things we can't test for or whose answers are not known or have massive scope for improvement which AI can't do. If it can, it will be AGI. For example, we don't know what makes good fiction so we can't test it. So AI can't write good fiction. We don't know the content of future knowledge so we can't test for it. So AI can't come up with new theories. Is this right? Yeah, absolutely. I completely agree with all of that.

### 1h 16m

As soon as the thing starts to come up with new knowledge, new explanations, not just versions of preexisting explanations but new explanations, then we're going to be in the presence of an AGI. And it's going to explain its own internal state. But before we get there, we're going to have a plan for an AGI. And even playing with chat GPT-4 today. And still it's making the same kind of errors as 3.5. It's clearly got a bigger database. It's more complex. Yeah. It's more impressive. But still we're not seeing new explanations there. Okay. That will do us for today. Gone for over an hour. More again, I would say, this time tomorrow.

### 1h 17m

But until then, I'll bid you adieu. Goodbye.
