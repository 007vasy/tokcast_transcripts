Welcome to TopCast for a special episode, an omnibus type episode so to speak, 99 minutes for my 99th episode devoted to The Beginning of Infinity, the book that started my podcast. This is going to be not a typical episode in the sense that often what I do is read part of the book and then reflect upon that book. Instead what I'll be doing is simply giving nothing but my reflections without ever referring directly to the book. There'll be very few quotes, there might be one or two here but I'm not going to have the book in front of me and reading passages out of it. For that of course you can go to the rest of my podcast series on The Beginning of Infinity where I do extensive readings.

### 1m

This is going to be very much a personal set of reflections on what I got from each and every chapter from The Beginning of Infinity. So it'll be very much in my words and shouldn't be taken as representative of what really is in the chapter. David provides summaries at the end of every single chapter and I guess they would be his main points but this will be my main takeaways from the book and at the end of each chapter that I discuss I'm going to give the... two or three sentence summary of what I think that chapter was about. And again, nothing official in this, this is just my takeaways and many people out there might quite disagree with what I'm taking away as the central message of that chapter. The Beginning of Infinity is special in many ways. Firstly, as Naval Ravikant has said there seems to be many people who purchase the work, somewhat fewer readers of the work and fewer still people who actually have a good understanding of what's being...

### 2m

said there. This is somewhat perplexing to me in a sense because I don't know why people wouldn't persevere with the book. I get why you wouldn't start the book to begin with, it's a fairly large tome and maybe you just want it to look good on your shelf there. But if you begin reading it, surely you find it captivating, it's amazing. I mean it's providing you with a different world view, a different way of seeing not only science and progress but just about every area of human interest. It's in some way or other other captured there within the beginning of infinity and it provides an optimistic alternative to all of those other misconceptions and worldviews that are out there at the moment i'm somewhat reminded of what popper said when it came to problems in one's life he said that you know essentially the purpose of life to some extent is to meet a problem to see its beauty and to fall in love with it to get married to it and to live with it happily till death do ye part unless you should meet another and even more fascinating problem

### 3m

end quote from popper well much the same could be said of a good book or even a sublime book like this one to meet it to see its beauty and to fall in love with it and basically to spend days and weeks pouring over it i'm sure some books are possibly pumped out rather quickly like so many blog posts are i know the feeling of having a particular thought tossing it over in my mind for a while and then i'm going to have to do it again and again and again and again and again and while and then feeling the urgent need to commit it to the page in the form of a longer or shorter blog post. I tend to think it over sometimes for only a matter of hours before committing it to the page but I also know the feeling of having an idea, committing it to the page in draft form and then tossing it over for days and weeks until it's refined to the point where I think yeah that's worth publishing. And so I think that many other books like popular science books and things they tend to read a little bit like blog posts of the first kind. They're something the authors have just had to say and had to publish very quickly or perhaps they've tossed it over in

### 4m

their minds for weeks and months, perhaps a year or two in some special cases. But I know the beginning of infinity took something like a decade to write and it really does show. The beginning of infinity stands apart because each page really does have a new insight. It's often something that counts. It counters prevailing misconceptions and it's clear, exceedingly clear and not merely clear but eloquent and this sets it apart. But the fact that it is so insightful I think is one reason that people might not at times persevere or even see the subtle importance of what's being said. If you're being hit rapid fire on every page with new ways of thinking about things, one might dare say everythings, it can be disorienting. This is the reason for my channel here and the podcast that I produce and the blog posts and so on because as so many others have said, some sentences in the beginning of infinity could be entire

### 5m

paragraphs. Some paragraphs could be entire chapters and some chapters could be entire books in themselves. So some unpacking and discussion is not necessarily needed but it is warranted. It's fun to engage with this stuff and see where the new ideas could potentially be put into practice. lead and how they might inform science, philosophy, decision-making, and thinking and progress broadly. So this episode is an unusual one. The plan is this. I'm going to take about four to five minutes per chapter and just highlight what I think is important, what was key for me out of that chapter. As I say, this time, no quotes, no reading, nothing direct, maybe except some incidental quotes here and there that I might remember off by heart or I feel I need to just pull out of the book. But in the main, it's going to be my interpretation of the chapters. So it's more like a translation of a kind. So it's more like the beginning of infinity

### 6m

filtered through me in a sense. So expect to lose something. Expect to lose a lot in that process. As I always say, none of this is a substitute for the book itself. At 18 chapters and four to five minutes per chapter, that gives me a few minutes here at the beginning to do this introduction and maybe some minutes at the end to do a little bit of the introduction. And what I'll do with these four to five minute breakdowns of each chapter is probably just publish them separately on Twitter as well as putting them together here and now for you as a complete podcast. And the reason for that is once again, I hope it really does entice people to pick up the book and delve more deeply into it. I know I've already done the 45 episodes on the beginning of infinity, and that is in fact close to two complete days worth of continuous beginning of infinity content, not counting the questions with David and the other things that I've published as well. But this is an interesting challenge. I think it's important to accept the

### 7m

reality sometimes that some people simply won't ever read the book. But the ideas in this book are just so important, especially right now, and will continue to be that we need to repackage them over and over again in formats more accessible to some people. The Naval podcast is doing that, I think, very successfully. If the feedback is anything to go by. Naval has great reach, of course, and extremely helpfully, a deep understanding and appreciation of these ideas. And one hopes that anyone inspired by Naval when it comes to the beginning of infinity and the fabric of reality will turn to those books. And so that's what I hope to do here as well. Turn to the book for more details, of course. There's so much Popper and Deutsch content out there now. All of David's interviews in various and the various other podcasts that are out there now as well. The Do Explain podcast, the Fallible Animals podcast, the Theory of Anything podcast, the Lunar Society podcast, to name just a few.

### 8m

David has really inspired an entire ecosystem of online podcasts and YouTube channels and blogs. So it's really getting difficult for someone who's a big fan like me to even keep up with everything that's out there now. And so I guess personally, I'm not really helping things right now by producing yet more. Beginning of infinity content. It's an embarrassment of riches to some extent. And I don't just mean the Popper and Deutsch related material. I also mean the broad intellectual science philosophy broadcasting space. All that said, I think our corner, the David Deutsch corner of the internet really is still David against Goliath. David being David Deutsch and the rest of us on his side of the ledger. And Goliath being... Well, mainstream misconceptions, mainstream academia in intellectual culture and all those other kinds of so-called rationality that are out there. Some better than others, but none

### 9m

quite getting to the heart of the matter about why it is we need to be optimistic, why it is that we continue to make progress and what it is about science and philosophy and reason that really sets humanity apart at this particular epoch in time and the people in the enlightenment tradition as compared to everything that has gone before. As I say, at the end of each chapter that I'm about to go through, I'm going to give you my personal key learning from the chapter. Emphasis on my others might very well take something else more important away, and maybe David's intention was something completely different to what I say is the central message that I got. Of course, the worst thing about even attempting this, of course, is that I've already said that each chapter could be an entire book in and of itself. So why would I go in the opposite direction and try and reduce the chapter? to a few sentences i just thought it'd be a cool curious little challenge that i'd set for myself so without further ado let's get to my brief reflections upon each chapter in the beginning

### 10m

of infinity the most groundbreaking work so far of the 21st century chapter 1 the reach of explanations in this chapter david deutsch makes some genuine progress in epistemology prior to popper we had this notion of empiricism that the way in which knowledge was generated was you went out into the world and you observe the world and from your observations you managed to derive knowledge from those observations in some way shape or form that was never really specified empiricism at least put observation at the center of knowledge creation it was a relief to be relieved from superstitious notions of how knowledge might be generated or the idea that certain orthodoxy or orthodoxy or orthodoxy are not the same as the orthodoxy of the world so the idea that authorities possess the knowledge the final truth to a certain extent or the best version of a truth and everyone else should agree with what the authority said was known

### 11m

or said was true we know that empiricism can't be true because we know that well seeing is not believing our go-to example in the beginning of infinity in various other places and the one which i always turn to is this idea of observing stars at night and seeing small dim points of light but is that what a star is a small dim point of light no and no amount of repeatedly making those same observations over and over again can get you one jot closer to the nature of what a star really is what we now know is that stars are not cold but hot not dim but bright they are extremely distant hot furnaces fusing hydrogen nuclei photons into helium and other more complicated processes as well and we only get to that notion not because we can actually observe the core of stars where these reactions are taking place

### 12m

in fact it's very rare for us to be able to observe directly a star whenever you take even a powerful telescope the star still appears as simply a point of light there are a few exceptions so we're not observing stars directly at all let alone the reactions that are going on inside them so how did we get this knowledge we had to conjecture it we had to guess it and then the function of our observations using telescopes and various other things was to criticize those theories and insofar as those theories were criticized and survived the criticism then we accepted that we had learned something new via this method of conjecture as popper told us about what the nature of stars are eventually our theory of stars became a good explanation and what we mean by good explanation is something that is hard to vary and this is the insight that david deutsch provides us in chapter one it is a genuine epistemological discovery prior to david deutsch popper rightly demarcated science from non-science via this criterion of falsification

### 13m

however as david points out falsifiable theories are a dime a dozen after all any crank wearing a sandwich board on the corner of the street saying the world is going to end next tuesday has a falsifiable theory and it will be falsified but simply because it's a falsifiable theory doesn't make it scientific just because it's testable doesn't make it scientific someone can say eat a kilogram of grass it'll cure your common cold it's a falsifiable theory but that does not make it scientific so what is david deutsch's great insight what we're after not only in science but everywhere are good explanations and a good explanation is something that counts for what is really going on in the world and which also is hard to vary which means every single part of the explanation has a purpose and in this view therefore experiments and observations serve the purpose of choosing between these theories that we've already guessed it's very rare for us to have

### 14m

more than one explanation for any given phenomena but where we do for example in the case of gravity we had newtonian gravity and we had einstein's general relativity we needed to craft an experiment a way of distinguishing between the predictions that these two theories made one of them was inconsistent with that theory we would say that the observation has refuted that theory while the other which is consistent with the observation the theory which is consistent with the observation we say has so far gone unrefuted and now remains our best explanation of that given phenomena and those explanations that we generate have reach they solve the problem they were created for in the first place and then go on to do even more general relativity fixes and so on and so forth but then it reaches into things like the expanding universe and the black holes and neutron stars and the gps system things that no one imagined two centuries ago

### 15m

under the newtonian gravity framework my key takeaway from this chapter is that knowledge creation is a process of guessing what is true and then criticizing those guesses leading gradually and ideally to the production of good by which we mean hard to vary explanations which can be derived from our observations chapter two closer to reality knowledge brings us closer to understanding reality this idea of realism is the claim that reality is out there and exists independent of what we happen to think about it but our knowledge what we come to understand of that reality which is beyond our minds as well as our minds being a part of that reality our knowledge of all of this can be objective and should be objective objective and that is objective in the sense that no subjective knower needs to be involved in order for the knowledge to actually be knowledge knowledge can be recorded in books or stored in

### 16m

computers it can even appear in objects the computer on which you are watching this is going to instantiate relationships between the circuits the knowledge of how to process information and should all of humanity be wiped out tomorrow but our artifacts including our computers left behind and an alien race found them then they could reverse engineer what is going on in the computer and therefore uncover the knowledge that's in the computer by decoding it and then they would know what we know what has been stored in the computers but how is it that knowledge brings us closer to reality it's interesting because sometimes in order to come closer to the reality we need to put multiple objects between us and that reality for example returning to the universe can bring us closer to reality and so trying to understand the nature of stars in order to better understand what a star is looking directly at it with an eye that's unaided by any technology is not going to bring you closer to the reality of what that star is

### 17m

instead putting between your eye a telescope and a computer will certainly help in the process of bringing you closer to understanding the reality of stars putting objects between you and that star and not only the objects but also existing explanations can bring you closer to understanding You can't see things directly because observation is theory laden. So when an astronomer puts a telescope between themselves and the star, they have to have an explanation first of how the telescope works. They have to understand whether and to what extent the telescope might be subtly changing the color of the star, whether there might be artifacts on the lens and so forth. Because after all, once you produce a picture of whatever the telescope is taking using the computer, you might very well end up with something that's on the printed page that is not actually out there in outer space, but it could just be an error introduced by the telescope or the computer processing of the image.

### 18m

This is the sense in which observation is theory laden. Even something as simple as straightforward looking relies upon a complex process of how light gets through the cornea of our eyes back to the retina. Now, converted from chemical energy into electrical energy, and then finally, somehow or other, translated by our minds into information of a sort. This process of seeing is extremely complicated. But so long as we're correcting errors, then we do come closer to the truth, because this is what knowledge growth really is. It consists of correcting errors and solving problems, errors in our existing theories. It's people who are the creative entities that do the science. And grow explanatory knowledge. People like Thomas Edison and others have said over the years that innovation is very much 99% perspiration and 1% innovation. But in fact, that's not true. The perspiration phases of creativity can very much be automated and increasingly are.

### 19m

What's so important now is imagination. The inspiration part. That's all of what science is about. Trying to find a problem and fall in love with it, as Popper says. And then attempting to find a solution. Unless, of course, you find a better problem along the way. So the truth is that in science, it's almost all, or ideally it should be, mainly creativity, imagination. My key takeaway for this chapter is that knowledge growth is about the identification of errors in our existing explanations and correcting them. And sometimes we need to put lots of things, like technology, such as telescopes and computers, as well as other explanations, between us and those parts of reality we're trying to understand in order to come closer to explaining what's really going on. Chapter 3. The Spark. It is common these days for intellectuals to embrace the so-called principle of mediocrity. That is the claim that people are nothing special.

### 20m

As recently as 2021, the year in which I am recording this, the biggest paid podcast on earth was called Absolutely Mental. And it featured Sam Harris. Sam Harris in conversation with the comedian Ricky Gervais. There have been two series so far. Now certainly, of course, it was mainly for entertainment and comedy purposes. But the subtext was, whenever they got into science and philosophy in a serious sense, it really was all about the principle of mediocrity. Over and again, Gervais made the claim and Harris, if not explicitly, at least tacitly, endorsed the notion that we are nothing special, we humans. There is a continuum between bacteria through to lower mammals. And then to us, we are just an incremental increase on what went before. Aren't dolphins and great apes so smart? Look at us. We're just so stupid for polluting, getting in wars and being cruel to other creatures. But this is not merely black comedy. It informs academia as well.

### 21m

Sadly, on this view, to some extent, you're an intellectual if you do denigrate people. Only silly religious people think humans are anything special. So this principle says we. Are nothing special. And also, the cosmological principle says that the Earth, planet Earth, is nothing particularly special. It's just a regular planet orbiting a regular star in a rather typical galaxy, one among hundreds of billions of them. But set against all of this is, in the minds of many, a version of what is called Spaceship Earth. Well, these days, many people say there is no planet B, even when there are literally many, many planet B's that have been discovered. Kepler 452B, Kepler 10B. Kepler 442B. Take your pick. There are even C's and D's and so on. Anyways, no planet B or Spaceship Earth says, in fact, the Earth is a special place and nowhere else is. But all of this is wrong. We humans are special and Earth is only special because we are here.

### 22m

We can make anywhere hospitable. The environment doesn't support us. It is barely suitable for us, as David says. Most places are inhospitable, even on the Earth. We make the place hospitable. And soon, we will make space hospitable. We've already begun. Only creative innovation allows for us to support ourselves here because the cosmos is dangerous, and so is Earth. Enlightenment knowledge is the spark that allows for unbounded progress off into an infinite future. This is explanatory knowledge that allows for the solving of human problems. The only other known type of knowledge in the universe is biological. Slow, incremental guessing and checking of blind mutations to see if there are any useful adaptations. So the spark is very much us. We people are the catalyst that takes inert, useless material and comes to understand what it is made of. We create knowledge of it, find out what it is, and only then it becomes useful, an actual resource.

### 23m

With this resource, we can begin the process of transforming ourselves. We can transform our environment into something hospitable. And our environment is the universe. Eventually, this ratcheting up of knowledge creation, allowing us to transform physical reality around us, will stretch out beyond the Earth, sparking knowledge creation throughout the solar system, and then the galaxy, and from there, who knows where. The Enlightenment has only just begun to glow in an otherwise implacably dark and hostile universe. Eventually, we will be able to transform ourselves. We will be able to transform ourselves. We will be able to transform ourselves. We will be able to transform ourselves. We can bring the rest of the universe to life by making it hospitable, just as we have done here on a far smaller scale. This is merely the beginning, the kindling of infinite progress. My key takeaway from this chapter, is that the Earth is a unique place, so far as we know, in the universe, where an open ended stream of knowledge creation is occurring.

### 24m

However, it will not remain this way as our Enlightenment traditions will spread to other planets and stars. and one day the rest of the universe. Chapter 4. Creation. Knowledge has to be created. Knowledge being useful information or information that solves a problem. There are two kinds known. The information in the DNA of an organism is useful so it counts as knowledge. It solves the problem of survival for an organism ideally but more precisely how the gene can spread through a gene pool. And the problem of how to be copied. Another feature which makes it knowledge. It appears via the process of evolution by natural selection as explained originally by Darwin and which we now know in a so-called neo-Darwinian framework as being about the selection of units on the DNA double helix called genes. Genes or groups of genes code for structures in the

### 25m

physical structure of an organism. Mutations of the DNA are in essence like guesses about what makes a gene. And the problem of how to be copied. Another feature which makes it knowledge. Might work in a given environment. Most are bad guesses and only damage the organism. Rarely some are mutations which are advantageous and survive into the next generation as they cause that organism to be more fit in the given environment. They go on to be copied generation after generation. This all looks a little like the growth of explanatory knowledge where existing ideas can be changed somewhat but most changes are not good. Knowledge in the DNA and in human minds of the explanatory sort is hard to vary. Small changes will ruin and not improve the knowledge broadly speaking. That both ideas and genes can be copied and are copied means they are replicators. But there do exist differences. Explanations can be deliberately changed, intelligently designed if you like, by the free and conscious choices of people who can see a

### 26m

problem and deliberate over it and consider the best knowledge available and imagine into existence new ideas. There is a genuine act of creation on their part but there is no mind behind the generation of biological knowledge. That is a blind process. And biological knowledge of that sort never does much more than ensuring the survival or not of a particular organism or species. While explanatory knowledge has reach. It solves the local problem a scientist for example is interested in only for it then to go on to solve problems elsewhere at different times. The problem of how to be copied is that the structure of the atom is eventually leads to uncovering the cause of radioactivity and eventually leads to the possibility of generating electricity for hundreds of millions perhaps even billions of people using nuclear fission reactions. Explanatory knowledge reaches into areas creators of it can never quite imagine initially. Evolution by natural selection replaced Lamarckism. The idea that biological knowledge can be acquired by some sort of process of

### 27m

extrapolation where giraffes necks got longer because they tried to escape from the environment. They try to make their necks longer. Similarly inductivism assumes that explanatory knowledge is a process of extrapolating from observations. Somehow the knowledge in both cases spontaneously appears out of trends. Both Lamarckism and induction are thus wrong. Evolution by natural selection solved an important problem. That of the problem of the appearance of design. But taking a look at the universe as a whole the physical laws and the constants there also have the importance of the appearance of design. The physical laws and the constants there also have the importance of the appearance of design. It seems as though the laws have just the right form and especially the right parameters. Those parts of a theory that needs to be measured. The constants of nature like the gravitational constant or the charge on an electron for the universe to be bio-friendly. But the claim that cosmologically fine tuning is solved by a designer suffers from the same flaw as it does in biology. We don't yet have an explanation for the appearance of

### 28m

fine tuning but this is only because we do not yet know enough. Whatever the case we shouldn't be leaping to it looks like design therefore it is design so there must be a designer that is exactly the same as the era in biological creationism before evolution by natural selection was known. We cannot say why there is an appearance of design in the physical laws but postulating a cosmological multiverse or a megaverse a multiverse of multiverses where the other universes have different laws doesn't solve the problem either. In truth this notion is rather too easy to understand. Easy to vary as it could account for any set of laws including the ones we know to exist in our universe. My key takeaway from this chapter is that both biological organisms and the physical constants in the universe that permit life have the appearance of design. But appearances can be deceiving. Although Darwin solved the problem of why life appears to be designed the question of why the constants of nature seem to be designed seem to be fine tuned remains unsolved.

### 29m

Chapter 5 The reality of abstractions What happens from one moment to the next in the physical universe is determined by laws of physics acting on fundamental particles. This description of reality happens to explain very little. It is at best predictive but even then in practice the prediction for large ensembles of particles is intractable and in principle there can be no computer so powerful in our universe that it could actually predict what happens moment to moment. Precisely because to know what happens next with high precision requires knowing now with high precision where all the particles are and how fast they are moving. But there is no single now because of the relativity of simultaneity. What has this to do with anything at all? This determinism is a form of reductionism where it is assumed, wrongly, that explanations at the lower level are necessarily superior to explanations at the emergent level.

### 30m

But sometimes... The emergent explanation, indeed, mostly it's the emergent explanation, in day-to-day life, is the only known, proper explanation. Our go-to example here is the parable of the copper atom as I've come to call it. It first appeared in the Fabric of Reality and I've done a number of podcasts on it, including one devoted exclusively to it, but in short it goes like this. In Parliament Square in London there stands a statue of Winston Churchill. It's made of bronze and at the tip of the nose of the statue... is a copper atom. Why is that copper atom there? The deterministic, predictive explanation goes like this. Matter was produced at the Big Bang, and some of that matter eventually coalesced into stars, and at the core of those stars, eventually, copper was fused during a supernova explosion. Some of that copper ended up forming the minerals on the Earth, which were mined, and under the action of the forces of the laws of physics, the copper

### 31m

atom eventually ended up at the tip of the nose of Winston Churchill. Now, that explanation works for anything, anywhere, anytime. It doesn't matter what the object is. It doesn't matter what the particle is that you're talking about. Beginning at the Big Bang, following the trajectories which are determined by the laws of physics, you will end up with the particles being where they are right now. That's predictive. It's not explanatory. A genuine explanation of what's going on is the reason there's a copper atom at the tip of the nose of Winston Churchill's statue is because we make statues out of things like bronze and brass, which contain copper, that helps them not corrode away quite so quickly. And the reason the statue is there at all in the first place is because Winston Churchill helped defend the West, the Enlightenment, against fascism. And we like to build statues honouring great leaders like that. And so that's why there is a copper atom at the tip of the statue in Parliament Square. Now, this explanation involves things in its full context of culture and choices and war and things that do not reduce to physical forces

### 32m

and fundamental particles. Things like culture and the choice to go to war involve abstractions, the reality of abstractions. Numbers, and not the numerals that represent them, but numbers are abstractions as well. Anyone can go online and look up now on Wikipedia what the highest presently known prime number is. We happen to know that there is an infinite number of prime numbers, but at any given time, we only know of a particular highest prime number. Now, what is the next highest prime number? We know it exists. But we haven't found it yet. Now, in what sense does it exist? Well, it doesn't exist in physical reality right now. No one's found it. It hasn't actually been transcribed into a computer anywhere. It hasn't been printed on sheets of paper. It doesn't exist in our physical universe. But it exists. It's an abstraction. And it can cause things to actually happen. That prime number actually causes people, human beings, to go out and search

### 33m

for it. So abstractions absolutely exist and can have causal effects on what goes on. It is not a physical reality. And it is not reducible just to the action of particles and physical forces. Perhaps the most controversial of all abstractions is this idea of free will. I regard free will as an abstraction. It is just the capacity to choose and sometimes to create knowledge, to freely choose to create knowledge, which wasn't there before. But our minds also are abstractions. They are instantiated presently in the neurons within our brains. But there is no reason in principle that whatever is going on in this world isn't a physical reality. That makes sense. What is abstractions? They are abstractions. We're just abstractions. There is no reason in the universe that we're not abstractions. They're abstractions. There is no reason in the universe that we're not abstractions. But there is no reason in principle that whatever is going on there is a physical Newton language. on in that brain could not be emulated simulated in the silicon workings of a computer which means whatever it is is not identical to the firings of the neurons in the brain my key takeaway from this chapter is that non-physical stuff or rather stuff that is independent of its physical instantiation in other words abstractions can affect physical stuff it is rarely the case that a description

### 34m

of events in terms of physical interactions is a complete explanation we often need to invoke really existing abstractions among the most important of which are ideas chapter six the jump to universality it is a jump to universality that really makes the difference between people by which we mean humans and the possibility of alien intelligence and perhaps in the future the possibility of artificial general intelligence it's a jump to universality that makes the difference between these kinds of people and all the other living entities that are out there those entities that cannot generate explanatory knowledge we have a kind of universality that is explanatory universality but what is this thing about a jump to universality well firstly the first kind of universality to have arisen that we know of seems to have been the dna code it is a code which cannot just make some limited number of organisms but rather can explore the space of

### 35m

all possible carbon-based life it's a strange kind of thing dna it can code for bacteria and single-celled amoeba and simple life but also fish and birds aquatic and air and land of course mammals and so on and some things in between like amphibians and reptiles it can do insects and dinosaurs and everything in between those basically if it can be alive and built from amino acids joining together to form proteins allowing cells to hold water in which are dissolved the cells to be able to build it it's a universal code for life human beings have created forms of universality as well take ways of communicating at first pictograms were used pictures representing words this system is not universal because if a new word was invented then a whole new picture was needed so the existing system could never represent whatever word or concept was needed when a discovery was made but our present various systems of alphabet

### 36m

for example the english alphabet is universal words might get longer or in some cases shorter but it's not like we're going to run out of letters or words and number systems like roman numerals are cumbersome and not so easy to use to represent large numbers or do complex arithmetic efficiently but the modern indian arabic system of zero to nine is universal it's easy to represent whatever number you like and perform with relative ease calculations in that system the numbers zero through to nine represent the number of numbers in the system so it's not like we're going to run out of letters or words and number systems like roman numerals are cumbersome and not so easy to use any number simply by changing the position of the number nine units nine tens nine trillions and so on all with a single digit and then add a few zeros it's universal the most important example in technology of universality is the computer the turing machine a device able to do the work of any other device that computed stuff was his invention including the human mind by the way it could do the work of that too so in principle the universal computer the universal turing

machine could be programmed with intelligence and then david deutsch made a further jump to universality with the notion of a quantum computer a computer that took advantage of the actual known laws of physics the quantum laws of physics to allow for quantum computation a far more efficient way of calculating certain things importantly things like quantum systems which meant that all physical systems could be efficiently simulated by this computer provably that includes human brains it's not a metaphor that the human brain is a computer it is the literal truth of the matter given the known laws of physics all of these computers quantum or classical rely on error correction making them digital devices the common feature of all these kinds of universality is that they exist in digital systems but the most important jump to universality in the universe is us the jump to explanatory universality even if other animals can think and i'm not sure that

### 38m

they can but if they can it is about a fixed range of things whatever is encoded in their genes but humans being people are universal in their capacity to explain the world this gives us a special relationship with the laws of physics because what it is in here going on in our minds comes to resemble what is out there over time with increasing fidelity my key takeaway from this chapter is that many systems gradually improve over time but sometimes some systems reach a point where there is a sudden increase in capacity such that the system is now able to do everything in some class of tasks for example although pre-humans might have been able to explain something about reality people today can explain everything that is explicable chapter 7 artificial creativity what is called artificial intelligence is really just an incremental improvement on the kinds of tasks

### 39m

that computers have always done calculating extrapolating and doing very little that is surprising a program that is created to learn to play computer games does exactly that it does not tend to stop and decide to write a poem on a word processor computers presently do precisely as they are programmed to do they do not disobey the people disobey creativity requires disobedience was known or acceptable before. What this tells us is that the programs running on these computers do not create anything new, only the programmers do. A computer that beats a chess grandmaster is impressive, but it is impressive because of raw power and clever programming. It is not creating new knowledge, it is literally calculating among known possibilities. It is not having fun and it

### 40m

is not ever able to do anything else other than that one thing. Even a computer programmed with a wide repertoire of abilities is not approaching universality of the explanatory kind. Universality of that kind, actual creativity, actual artificial general intelligence, intelligence like ours, has no fixed repertoire. We can invent new tasks, unlike a computer. We have problem situations. Likewise, evolutionary algorithms are not examples of actual evolution being simulated either. A PhD student who designs a robot with legs, or even just simulates one, which then goes on to learn to walk through trial and error, has been given a fixed task, learn to walk. And it has a criteria for learning to walk, so it is unsurprising that it manages to achieve this modest task eventually. But if it then begins to dance a waltz without ever being programmed, that would be a truly impressive display,

### 41m

of evolution. And if it ever then went on to invent beautiful new dances no one had ever seen before, then we should all think we are in the presence of an actual artificial intelligence, an AGI, a person. Until then, all we have are dumb computers. Impressive. A Tesla car is impressive, but it's not intelligent. When a programmer writes a so-called evolutionary algorithm, the thing is, they are putting their explanatory knowledge into the code, and some of the information that they are putting into the code is not intelligent. Some of that knowledge has reach. What this means is that the knowledge itself ends up being able to solve problems the programmer might not have thought of. But this does not mean the code, or the knowledge, or certainly not the robot, is actually thinking of those problems. It just means that the problem is encountered, and the code was already a solution for that problem. There's a thought experiment in this chapter which basically goes, a true evolutionary algorithm, if it is to replicate evolution by natural selection, is a problem that is not thought of. And it's not thought of by the

### 42m

computer, which, recall, is an iterative process of random mutations, the random being important here. Anyways, an actual evolutionary algorithm would not begin with the knowledge of the programmer. It would begin with almost no knowledge. So if we took, say, a robot that could walk, replace its program by a sequence of random numbers, and then have a random number generator introduce more random numbers each time the program is run, and you keep the same criteria in the program, it would not be able to solve the problem. So if we took, say, a robot that could walk, program for succeeding as in any usual evolutionary algorithm, if after some years of doing this the robot ends up walking at all, then we've refuted the idea that in those other programs it was all just the programmer's knowledge achieving the task after all and not evolution. Evolution is after all blind and the mutations are random. This thought experiment also points to the fact we do not understand how actual evolution by natural selection works in very fine detail either. We know there has been a ramping up of complexity in some species over time. We cannot say precisely

### 43m

why because our existing understanding of the theory says that evolution is blind and as always the maxim, if you can't program it you haven't understood it, holds. In both cases, evolutionary creativity and explanatory creativity, we do not understand how to program a computer to simulate either of them, which would be to actually create a version of either. And at least in part this is because we do not understand how universality in either of these cases is operating and represented in the DNA or the human mind respectively. My key takeaway from this chapter is if you can't program it, you haven't understood it. And we can program neither the ability to simulate the creation of biological knowledge nor of explanatory knowledge using our computers. Indeed, first we're going to need algorithms for both to be constructed before we can program a computer to simulate the creation of biological knowledge. Therefore, we can begin to think about actually writing some code. Chapter Eight, A Window on Infinity. Mathematical infinities can produce some seeming paradoxes.

### 44m

David Hilbert imagined an infinity hotel to push our intuitions about infinity around. If you consider a hotel with an infinite number of rooms and all of them are full, then you might think that well if they're all full there's no room for more patrons. But let's think a little more carefully. Unlike with a regular finite hotel, if infinity hotel is full, it doesn't actually mean there's no more room. For example, if another guest does arrive, all the management need to do is to announce via the PA system that everyone should move to the next highest numbered room. So the person in room one moves to room two, the person in room two moves to room three, and so on. That would leave room number one unoccupied. There is no last room, so it's not a problem what actually goes on there. However, infinity hotel can be overwhelmed.

### 45m

This is because room numbering in infinity hotel consists of countable room numbers. You can literally count them, one, two, three, four, and so on. But some infinities are uncountable. It was Georg Cantor who proved using a diagonal argument how some infinities are larger than others. The way a diagonal argument works is this. Imagine the room in infinity hotel were assigned one of the decimal numbers between zero and one. There are clearly an infinite number of those. Would we be able to assign one decimal number identically to one of the hotel rooms? Imagine we did this at random. So room one got assigned to the number 0.5567, and that goes on forever. That ellipse there, the three dots, means the number continues without end. Imagine room two is 0.5567, and that goes on forever. That ellipse there, the three dots, means the number continues without end. Imagine room two is 0.5567, and that goes on forever. That ellipse there, the three dots, means the number continues without end. Imagine room three is 0.971, four is 0.509, and you keep on doing this for all the rooms in the hotel. Would any decimals

### 46m

be left over? Would some ever go unassigned? What about this number? Let's construct it by differing from the number assigned to room number one by the first digit. So instead of it being 0.5, let's take the five, and we're going to take the five, and we're going to take the five, and we're going to change it to a six, but you could pick any number that you like. So, so far, we've got 0.6, and let's say it differs from the second number by the second digit in some way. So instead of 0.54, so instead of the four in that second place, we will take that and change it into a two arbitrarily. And in the third number, we take the third digit, and we change that, and so on for all of the numbers assigned to the rooms of the hotel. By the end of this process, you will have constructed a number different from any of the numbers assigned to any of the rooms in the hotel. And so there would be a decimal number that appears between zero and one that is unassigned to

### 47m

any room in the hotel by definition. This is a diagonal argument, and you've produced there a proof of an uncountable infinity, a kind of infinity that includes numbers not in the infinite sequence that you might otherwise think contains all the possible numbers. The curious thing is about counting integers is that no matter where you start, you're always unusually close to the beginning, because you're always infinitely far from the end. There is no end after all. You're infinitely far from infinity. And in physical reality, we like to say we're here at the beginning of infinity, and we'll always be at the beginning of infinity and unusually close to it. That's what infinity just happens to be like. We live in a multiverse where we actually can't count the universes. There might be uncountably infinitesimal, but there are infinite numbers of universes and therefore copies of each of us that differentiate into infinitely many copies over time. And we, as the knowledge creators in physical reality,

### 48m

only know something of whether a thing is true or false because the laws of physics allow us to do the knowing, the proving or the calculating or explaining that is possible to do, given the physical brains that we have. It is therefore physics that underpins what it is possible for us to claim to know, including to prove in mathematics. That some mathematical theorem is true or false may be independent of physics, but our fallible human knowledge of that theorem is not independent of physics, but bound by it. After all, our brains are physical objects. Proof and explanation are physical processes. My key takeaway from this chapter is that we are always at the beginning of infinity, so we are still unusually primitive compared to people of infinity. We are thus lucky compared to our ancestors, but terribly unlucky compared to our descendants.

Chapter 9 Optimism All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge. This is what David Deutsch has called the principle of optimism. To some extent it is a special case of problems are soluble. Unless there is a physical law preventing us from solving the problem, then the problem can be solved. By creating the knowledge needed to solve that problem. Among all the categories of different problems that exist, evil is one kind. Not all problems cause suffering or evil. Only some do. Some problems are fun and lead to no harm at all. The problem of how to improve the CGI in a movie is not an evil, but it is a soluble problem and fun for some to try and figure out a solution to. But problems which do cause suffering, evils, are due to our not knowing how to fix that problem. Yes, serial killers are an evil, but so are earthquakes and cyclones. If we knew how to prevent or murder, we would do so, but we don't know how.

### 50m

And the same is true of any other natural disaster. People do evil things because they don't know better. Morally, they do not know what the right thing is, even if they claim they do know what the right thing is and choose to do otherwise. This is still an example of a lack of knowledge, a lack of actual moral knowledge, which would have directed their behaviour towards something else. In morality, as in physics or mathematics, it is possible to make objective progress. With morality considered as that domain concerned with what to do or what to do next or what you should do, there is something objectively better, and something objectively worse, in the choices before you. And in the limit, there must be something like an optimal choice to make, given the values of any particular person. And those values are themselves claims about what is right, and they could possibly be wrong, and so they can be improved. All of this means that in morality as in physics it is PSOSSIBLE to be wrong, and because there

### 51m

is something to be objectively wrong about, there are true and false claims we can make in these areas. What we need to do everywhere is to seek out good explanations, as there will never come a time where in any domain our knowledge is anything like complete. There can be no end of science. And nowhere can we go without perfect criticism of the evidence science and no end of progress. Fallibilism is the claim that we might be wrong about something and this is an optimistic way of viewing the world because the capacity to be wrong means the capacity to error correct and hence the possibility of making objective progress and that is always our circumstance. At the level of society we want an open and dynamic society, one that has a tradition of criticism. A tradition of criticism means we take nothing for granted and attempt to objectively improve our best explanations over time by incremental means. The key thing here is error correction, identifying errors where we can find them

### 52m

and conjecturing ways to correct those errors. What is important for our civilization is to continue to preserve the means of error correction. Our society, the civilization that continues the enlightenment tradition, has been especially long-lived and uniquely long-lived in fact, preserving error correction. Error correction means preserving our civilization because that means preserving progress and problem solving. For almost all of geological history on this planet, whenever an asteroid was on a collision course with Earth, it struck this planet. For the first time ever, our planet is in the unique position in the universe so far as we know where asteroids will be repelled by a planet. Our planet in the form of our technology created through our knowledgeable use of technology. So whenever anyone says that the chance of civilization being destroyed by an asteroid is 1 in 10,000 in the next 100 years, what they mean is completely absent human knowledge and

### 53m

choices. We cannot prophesy the future with any reliability because we cannot predict what people will choose to do in the future. And especially, we cannot predict what knowledge they will choose to do. This is as true for climate change and viruses as it is for asteroids. It is never a matter of probability but knowledge. Problems are soluble. My key takeaway from this chapter is that all evils are due to a lack of knowledge. If we continue to create the wealth needed to fund the solutions to solve our problems, we will be in the best position to prepare for the unknown problems of tomorrow. Chapter 10. A dream of Socrates' dream. In this chapter, David explains epistemology, what knowledge is and how we create it, through a dialogue largely between the god Hermes and Socrates. In this chapter, we find that all

### 54m

knowledge is conjectural. It is guessed. But that doesn't stop it from being objective. It tracks reality and is independent of what anyone believes to be true about that knowledge. And so knowledge is not what the ancients say, a form of justified true belief. After all, the standard of justifying as true is impossibly high to begin with. And as for believing knowledge, well, there are many instances where not only would this not be desired, it would be absurd. It would be wrong to believe as true a flat earth, but constructing the concrete base of your home on the assumption that the ground there is ideally flat is a reasonable one. But you don't need to believe that. I also don't need to believe Newton's law of gravity. I know it. It's part of my knowledge. But there's no possible way I can justify it to be true. Indeed, I know it. Yet, it is knowledge. It solves a problem. We cannot see what is before our eyes. That we can or that we should endorse the claim that seeing is believing ignores most of what is interesting

### 55m

in science and elsewhere. I cannot see the atoms before my eyes. I cannot see the oxygen in the air that I breathe. Yet I know about atoms and I know about oxygen. Knowledge is not primarily about the information our senses provide us with. In fact, it is more about correcting the errors in the misconceptions our senses deny. In fact, our senses lead us astray all the time. Indeed, our thinking can. And anything, therefore, can be doubted. Just because we cannot think of a misconception right now about a piece of knowledge that we have does not mean that piece of knowledge is once and for all finally true. It may just mean we have a lack of imagination. Consider the claim that through any two points a unique straight line can be drawn. This is not actually true. Look into that a little. Perhaps here. Whatever the case. The idea that there is just one central moral maxim. That is, the moral maxim that brings morality to some extent within the sphere of epistemology. The one thing we should never do. We should never

### 56m

destroy the means of error correction. This idea of should, that's a moral claim. This idea of error correction, that's epistemology. And further, our latest understanding coming from constructor theory is we might also say that what is possible to error correct and ultimately how to correct an error is a matter of physics. And this is pure speculation on my part, but in a distant future, might there be a physics of morality? What I am not trying to say is that we will ever be able to determine by some calculation what to do morally. But what I do mean is that perhaps physics itself will place limits upon us morally, even if it cannot tell us what to do. It will say perhaps what is impossible amongst all of our shoulds. But this is beyond the scope of this chapter. I'm cheating a little bit. The chapter here also contains our perspective on the so-called Socratic problem, the problem of what Socrates, the philosopher, really said or thought. What we know of Socrates comes to us filtered through the writings of Plato. And while Socrates seems in

### 57m

some moods to be a fallibilist, Plato wasn't. Plato was a genius, of course, but also all sorts of wrong on epistemology and political philosophy and morality and mathematics and so on. So it may be that he simply misunderstood Socrates, his teacher. Misunderstanding is the name of the natural state of affairs, of course. As Popper admonished, it is impossible to speak in such a way as to not be misunderstood. In this chapter, David also makes some remarks about the nature of philosophy compared to other academic disciplines. In philosophy, as it appears in universities, there's rather a lot of attention paid to the history of philosophy. What this or that ancient or classical philosopher actually said or meant. It should perhaps be more like physics or chemistry or science broadly, where we almost have to be able to understand the nature of philosophy. But it's not that we must never consult the original source of some idea or theory. Instead, we just take the idea itself for granted and then make some progress. My key takeaway from this chapter is that knowledge is not derived from the senses. It is we people who

### 58m

create it in our minds by a process of guesswork. We guess what is true and criticize those guesses in the light of our observations and other kinds of refutation. The purpose of observation is to decide between the two. The purpose of observation is to decide between the two. The purpose of observation is to consider both the physical and the physical. The purpose of observation is to answer both the physical and the physical. Chapter 11. The Multiverse. The experiments in quantum theory can only be properly explained by recourse to a physical reality that is stupendously larger than the one we observe. This continues that tradition in science that the size of the reality we inhabit seems to only ever be going in one direction, getting bigger and bigger to include more and more stuff that we don't ever hope to directly observe. To explain the motion of particles we do see in our universe, we need to invoke the existence of entities we do not see. These other entities are behaving like fundamental particles,

### 59m

which means they are fundamental particles, because they affect the fundamental particles we can see. This stupendously large ensemble of entities, beyond what we can see, we call the multiverse. There are many experiments that are used to illustrate this reality. One is known as the Mark-Zehnder interferometer. Here, two half-silvered mirrors are placed with two regular mirrors. The half-silvered mirrors allow photons, particles of light, to either go through, be transmitted, or bounce off, be reflected. At the first mirror, we cannot predict in our universe whether a given photon will be transmitted or reflected. We can only say that it's got a 50% chance of either. At the second half-silvered mirror, at the end of the experiment, what happens is that the photon is always detected at the arrow that says, photon out, and never at the nothing out arrow. But why? Why isn't it 50-50 here as well as it was in the first mirror? The reason is that in truth, at the first mirror,

### 1h 0m

what happens is that the photon that interacts with that mirror is a multiversal object. That means it occupies many universes. We are in one universe, or one group of universes, so can only detect it either, going along with it, or going away. We know this is true because only if that photon takes both paths, the one we see and the one we do not see, can we explain how the two photons interfere at the second mirror and recombine there, causing it to always go in only one of those directions rather than both. This is the only explanation. Something is interfering with the photon at the second mirror and that something is its counterpart. In the other universe, if we did not live in a multiverse, if our universe did not consist of many things that we do not observe, we should expect a 50-50 split as at the first mirror. What is happening at that first mirror is that the photon differentiates into two groups

### 1h 1m

and thus, so do the universes and the observers in those universes. This is going on all the time. All objects we can see are multiversal objects. They exist in the universe we observe and many others we do not. Sometimes with slight or even very great variations. And the truth is deeper still. What we observe is a universe, but it is a universe of objects that have fungible instances. Perfectly identical instances in the same place, at the same time, that occupy different universes. So they are different in that sense because they could potentially partition themselves into universes which cease to be fungible. The theory of quantum computation requires that a multiverse exists because it is a multiverse. otherwise impossible to explain what quantum computers are in principle and one day will be in practice capable of doing namely a quantum computer would be able to perform calculations that a computer even the size of our entire universe could not possibly do and it can only

### 1h 2m

do this because it the quantum computer can take advantage of computing power in other universes using interference we cannot explain how a quantum computer does what it does in retrospect by appealing to a single classical history we have to invoke once more the existence of histories we observers did not occupy this again is testament to physical reality being more than just a single classical universe and as unpalatable as it might be to some people this means we're in a multiverse many semi-parallel at times barely interacting and sometimes not interacting universes a person on this view in the multiverse is a channel of information flow along which knowledge grows this is unique in the universe and this knowledge may turn out to be among some of the longest persisting structures in the multiverse for more on all of this see my now seven part and indeed more than seven hours series on the multiverse right here and see also

### 1h 3m

this the Nexus video for more on what the philosophy of people and the philosophy of self might be in the multiverse my key takeaway here is that the physical universe is a stupendously larger than what we can ever hope to observe we call the approximately autonomous regions closed off from us other universes and together with our own universe we call the entire ensemble the multiverse chapter 12 a physicist's history of bad philosophy a reason why the everett or quantum multiverse is not more widely known taught or even taken seriously by actual practicing quantum physicists is bad philosophy there was a retreat into some sort of relativism and instrumentalism by physicists in the early 20th century instrumentalism is a fancy word for this idea of shut up and calculate it is the idea that science properly considered is simply about being able to predict the outcome of experiments

### 1h 4m

rather than actually understand and hence be able to explain what is really going on in reality anyways this chapter is about how the equations of quantum theory describe particles as seeming to be in multiple places simultaneously and having multiple velocities simultaneously so to take the theory and the formalism literally as a description of reality particles do have those properties however when you go to observe any single particle we find it in a single place so how do we square this the theory is saying one thing the particle has multiple positions at the same time and our observation the particle only has one position at a time Well, if you're a physicist struggling to understand all this in the early 20th century, you may well throw your hands up in the air and say all the possibilities, except for the one we observe, collapse or disappear upon the act of observation. This seems to put the observer, the act of observation, right in the center of fundamental physics.

### 1h 5m

Observation is doing something fundamental to the physical theory, and that has led to all sorts of nonsense claims ever since being made about quantum theory bringing in consciousness and mind to the quantum realm. This idea that observation destroys all the positions a particle was occupying, except for one, is known as the measurement problem. How it actually happens, no one could say, and people gave up for a time trying to really find out. They just accepted it. All of this was at least in large part motivated by bad philosophy. This is philosophy that's not merely false, but it actively prevents the growth, the growth of knowledge. The idea that science should only be about predicting the outcome of experiments acts to prevent us from improving actual explanations of reality. After all, it rules out explanation as even being a part of science in the first place. But bad philosophy has not only affected physics,

### 1h 6m

it's also infected some other sciences, or what should be sciences, like psychology. Behaviorism in psychology is instrumentalism, as applied to that subject, and says that because we cannot directly observe, we can only observe human behavior, and trends in human behavior, then this serves as a proxy for understanding why people do what they do. This denies ever having good explanations of the human mind. Consider that an antidepressant may make a person objectively happier, or it may simply lower their standards for what they think of as happiness. Presently, there is no good explanation, and no experiment that can distinguish these two possibilities. Happiness could be a good explanation, and no experiment that can distinguish these two possibilities. Happiness could be a good explanation, and no experiment that can distinguish these two possibilities. But if there is a clear state of continually solving your problems, and when you are constantly thwarted in solving your problems, then your happiness turns to unhappiness. But behaviorism looks at behaviors including people's self-reporting, that's a behavior, talking that indicates more or less happiness, without ever wondering what the causal link between

### 1h 7m

what is actually going on in the mind in terms of thoughts and ideas and what causes behaviors is. We call this explanationless science. It might all look like real science is going on, Experiments might be done, papers written, graphs with trend lines produced, but if we cannot ever say why something or other constitutes happiness in the first place, if we do not have an explanation of what a particular mental state is at the level of ideas in the mind, then we cannot hope to maximize it, let alone treat deficiencies of it. Bad philosophy continues through to today. Relativism is a form of bad philosophy that denies the possibility of objective knowledge and objective truth. It really took off soon after Wittgenstein published his major works. Wittgenstein thought most of philosophy reduced to puzzles and it was all just about language that people were using rather than actual philosophical problems. Wittgenstein is still extremely popular today. Many people think that philosophy is just about argumentation rather than solving particular philosophical problems.

### 1h 8m

Reducing every single problem to nothing but a puzzle in language is quite a dangerous route to go down. And it breeds a form of relativism, which we inherit today in certain kinds of wokeism. My key idea from this chapter is that instrumentalism is the idea that the purpose of science is to predict the outcome of experiments. This constitutes a kind of bad philosophy, which we define as philosophy which actively prevents the growth of knowledge by denying reality or truth or the possibility of finding good explanations. Chapter 13. Choices. When people have a choice before them. It is often not a case that pure logic and therefore any mathematical process of objectively weighing options is going to lead them to the best choice. Instead, what people actually do, both individually and even when acting as part of a group, is to creatively conjecture new options no one had on the table before.

### 1h 9m

So it cannot be a process of weighing existing options because the existing options can always be changed. Social choice theory. Social choice theory is an attempt to turn decision making by people into a purely logical exercise to make it perfectly rational. The motivation, I suppose, was a noble one. Take out the messy emotions and subjective feelings from the issue and look simply at the facts and apply some rigorous rational mathematical framework to the situation and see which choice is actually calculated to be best. The problem with this is that all such schemes for trying to turn decision making into a branch of mathematics. The problem with this is that all such schemes for trying to turn decision making into a branch of mathematics. Encounters what are known as no-go theorems, paradoxes and things that are simply illogical. One of the most famous of these discussed in the book is known as Arrow's theorem. This theorem is about how a group might come to a consensus. Arrow begins with a set of axioms that any such group would want to adhere to if they're going to make a rational choice.

### 1h 10m

These uncontroversial axioms, the starting points, would be things like, Well, if a group is going to be... unanimous on a particular decision, then that decision should be whatever the unanimous vote happens to be. Logical. Another axiom is called the no dictator axiom. One person cannot be said to represent the whole group unless everyone already agrees. And consult the book for the others or look up Arrow's theorem. These axioms are completely uncontroversial. You'd want to be able to agree with them. Here's the problem. What Arrow showed is that the uncontroversial axioms, despite being perfectly reasonable, are also inconsistent logically with one another. In other words, they cannot all be satisfied simultaneously. This is a deep problem, a fatal blow to the idea that decision making can always be a perfectly logical exercise. So what do we do? Do we just

### 1h 11m

give up on logic? No. What we do in the book is that we give up on logic. We give up on logic. These cases, whether individually or as a group, is to create new options and have a good explanation either for some existing option or the new one. We then choose among our options by choosing among the explanations and criticizing and hence refuting the other options. This is actually how decision making works. It's not a process of weighing, but criticizing. Truly objective decision making more resembles objective science. We have some theories or policies at the level of society. We have some theories or policies at the level of society. We have some and we seek to refute all of them, except for one, ideally. And that one that goes unrefuted, that survives the critical process, that's the one we accept as our best explanation or as our best policy. Or if none of them happen to be satisfactory, what do we do? We use our creativity as people to invent a better theory or policy. Democracies are systems of government for making decisions. But the quality of a democracy is to be judged not by whether the best ruler is installed

### 1h 12m

to what extent. This is isomorphic with the error that science is about finding the once and for all true theory. Instead, what democracy is, is a system for removing rulers and policies easily without violence. That is the standard by which we judge democracy and its institutions broadly. This also means that the plurality voting system is the best system of voting, because it means a ruler can be more easily removed if they're a bad ruler. This is unlike in any preferential voting system, where that bad ruler can form a coalition and get preferences to keep themselves in power. The more parties there are, the more coalitions can form, and this means deals are done to keep themselves in power, even when the voters no longer want those elected officials in office. Politicians like preferential voting systems for this reason. And on this point, compromise has an undeservedly good reputation. What a compromise is, is a theory

### 1h 13m

that wasn't anyone's first choice in the first place. So when it fails, as inevitably it often will, everyone involved in the compromise can turn around and say, well that's not what I ever wanted anyway, and therefore no one actually learns anything when the compromise fails. My key takeaway from this chapter is that making a choice is about choosing the best explanation. When there are options before you, the only rational thing to do is to criticize them in the hope that all but one of them are refuted. If none are satisfactory, then we use our creativity to come up with a better option. And unless there's a threat of violence, don't compromise. Chapter 14. Why are flowers beautiful? Aesthetics, art, music and beauty are all domains of objective knowledge. Yes, people have subjective preferences. No one denies this. But this is not to say that there is no such thing as one particular

### 1h 14m

thing in truth, in reality, actually being more beautiful than another. There are objective differences, not merely between noise and music, but between music of different epochs, the proverbial cave people banging on drums and modern music today, or cave art and modern 3D computer generated art. Cave people would have liked to know how to paint better, and there really is a better. They would like to have made objective progress in their art and storytelling. The waste paper basket, as we like to say, of the musician and the composer fills up the space. And that's what we're talking about. We're talking about the time because they are trying to reach an objective standard, trying to make something sound better, and not merely to them, but to everyone. And in actual truth, some sounds simply are more harmonious, more beautiful than other combinations of sounds. The fact that today we cannot rank order all musicians that have ever existed from worst to best in a way that everyone would agree with does not mean there are no objective standards. It just means that we don't know

### 1h 15m

much about those objectives. And that's why we're talking about the fact that we're not talking about objective standards yet. And those standards are sometimes swamped by, yes, the subjective taste of people. But the existence of subjective taste does not rule out the existence of real objective standards in music and elsewhere in art and aesthetics. Beauty, if we think of it as attractiveness, is something humans have tried to produce and surround themselves with since time immemorial. An art piece is objectively beautiful because people are attracted to it by the measure of its beauty. And people return to it over and over again in the gallery. Not all of what is called art does this. Some art rejects the notion of beauty altogether and exists rather to provoke or make a political point. But again, this rejection of beauty is likewise no proof that objective beauty and the capacity for something to be more or less attractive does not exist. The existence of creationism doesn't show that there's a problem with evolution by natural

### 1h 16m

selection. Likewise, the Museum of Modern Art, which is the museum of modern art, which is the Duchamp Urinals, doesn't prove that the classical art gallery does not contain objectively better art. Flowers are attractive. Insects are attracted to flowers, but so are people. Whatever it is that flowers are doing in creating beauty in nature, it acts to attract both insects and people. Something needs to be explained here. There must be some objective standard of beauty operating, even if we cannot in fine detail say exactly what it is. It seems to be the case that flowers are beautiful because they needed a way to signal across diverse species. Insects co-evolved with flowers, and so the flowers evolved to be beautiful. And we humans seek out objective beauty also. So we find flowers beautiful because they are actually in reality beautiful. It's not just our opinion. Evolution designed them that way to attract insects. People enjoy objective beauty because we are trying to signal across the wide,

### 1h 17m

wide gap between us and other humans. Between one human person and another, there is a vast gap in preferences and knowledge and more besides. The differences between one person and another are like the differences between species. So if we are to signal to one another what we like, we will learn to appreciate objective beauty too, and so we will create things more and more beautiful. This signaling to one another and attracting one another to our creative output is what we're all about. The best way to do this is by finding those objective standards of beauty, just as flowers did. My key takeaway from this chapter? There is a parochial kind of beauty. We've all got our own tastes and preferences, yes, but there are also objective standards for beauty, some of which have evolved in flowers, and many of which we have only just begun to discover through our creative and artistic endeavors. Chapter 15. The Evolution of Culture.

### 1h 18m

This chapter contains some really new and deep insights about memes. The concept of a meme was invented by Richard Dawkins, and is the abstract analog of a gene. In other words, it's a replicator of a kind. It contains knowledge, certainly information, and can be combined in complex ways to direct behavior. Moreover, memes evolve. In short, memes are a kind of idea, a kind of idea that persists, but may also change gradually over time. Cultures consist of many memes, and Deutsch's deep insight in this chapter is that there are important differences between cultures in terms of their memes. Deutsch refines this notion to be about dynamic and static societies. Why is it that so many societies have gone extinct, especially given that the brains of people in the past were anatomically almost indistinguishable from the ones we have today? They, those primitive people, had the capacity to be creative,

### 1h 19m

so why would they be able to be creative? Well, because they used their creativity to keep things the same, something that I will return to in the next chapter. Ideas that people have which tend to keep a society the same, or in other words, actively prevent the growth of knowledge, are called anti-rational memes. These are not merely irrational ideas, which might be thought of as bad ideas, but rather anti-rational memes are the ones which say, you may not criticize this thing. They disable the person's critical faculties. So you can imagine all sorts of evil notions, like those that say, if you do raise an objection to anything in this holy book, you can be put to death. This acts to prevent anyone from criticizing the holy book, and in time, it stops them even being able to think of criticisms. It is an anti-rational meme, and it can get replicated as parents teach their children that, and their children teach their children, and so on. But a rational meme is one which relies on a person's critical faculties to get itself replicated in the first place.

### 1h 20m

A person tries to criticize the idea, but fails to find any valid criticism, and so they pass it on because they think, that's a good idea. Implicitly, they think, I couldn't refute it, so I'm going to regard this as part of my knowledge, and I'm going to spread it out into the world. Theories in science are like this. So are musical tunes and jokes. The underlying idea gets passed on, even if it's not verbatim. A culture is a set of ideas or memes that cause the people in that culture to behave in more or less similar ways, but there is an important way to distinguish between two extreme kinds of society. The two extremes are a static society. This is the one that is ruled by anti-rational memes for the most part. In such a society, centuries and millennia can pass, and almost nothing changes. But a dynamic society, a society like ours, is ruled by rational memes, where the anti-rational memes have not quite been eliminated, but minimized to a large extent.

### 1h 21m

It is one where the thing that... stays the same, is change. The Enlightenment is the longest surviving example of a society where it is dynamic because there exists this overarching anti-anti-rational meme. A rational meme, in other words, but a special kind of rational meme that guards against the anti-rational kind. And that meme is the traditions of criticism, or the tradition of criticism, if you like. The underlying idea of which is this. It's all up for grabs, and you can criticize anything. Free speech and institutions protect you. Protecting free speech, and more besides, to protect the means of progress. Now, there is no perfect example of either a static society, something that really doesn't change at all over time. Even the near static societies do change, but very, very gradually. And even our culture is not a perfect example of a dynamic society. There are threats, even now, that slow down progress. The creeping wokeism and so on, and kinds of political correctness that cause people to not criticize ideas for...

### 1h 22m

fear of offending someone, or suffering legal action. But, in the main, our society is a very robust and good example of a dynamic society. We are the best society to have ever existed. Primitive societies were unimaginably bad. We are always at the beginning of infinity, so even our society is transitioning. And because of creativity, which is error prone, we will always be transitioning to something even more dynamic. My key takeaway from this chapter? Dynamic societies like ours value criticism, and protect our ability to correct errors in our ideas through the propagation of rational memes. This stands in stark contrast to static societies, where anti-rational memes have taken hold, disabled their holders' critical faculties, and make people reluctant to criticize, and therefore improve existing ideas in the culture. Chapter 16. The Evolution of Creativity.

### 1h 23m

Humans are creative entities. Our defining feature is that we can create explanatory knowledge. Any other people in the universe, be they aliens or artificial general intelligence, will be able to explain their environment. So why is it then, that for most of human history, most humans, living in primitive societies, failed to do much good explaining? Hence, why did they fail to make much progress? The Enlightenment began around 1700, or maybe a little bit before, and the Industrial Revolution began to happen just a little bit later than that. But why did neither of these things happen a thousand or even ten thousand years earlier, if people had the same capacity for thinking and creativity as the people then did, and the people today have? The answer is that the creativity they did have was being used to keep things static, the same and unchanging. In a static society, the way to stand out as a good person, and get a mate, or get respect, or gain authority and so on,

### 1h 24m

would be to enact the memes of that society, the culture, ever more strictly. To be especially static in your outlook. To be especially obedient and uncreative. The replication of a meme takes creativity. It cannot be copied directly because we do not have direct access to each other's minds. And what we do when we copy a meme, or rather replicate it, is to replicate its meaning. That's the whole content of a meme, its meaning. Some thinkers on the topic, for example the wonderful Susan Blackmore, who has popularized the field of memetics as much as anyone, has suggested meme replication occurs by imitation. But David Deutsch explains that this is not possible, because we do not have direct access to the memes, the ideas in people's minds or brains, in order to do this. Instead, what actually happens is we observe behavior, and we don't directly copy that either. It certainly looks as if we are copying, but it can't be that. After all, let's imagine a simple example.

### 1h 25m

A child learning to wave back at someone. If it was all about copying that behavior, would that mean going to stand where the other person is and wave from that exact location back towards where the child was previously standing? Would it mean the child getting a stool and standing on it so their hand is the same height as the person waving at them? Would it mean putting a little bit of artificial hair on their arm so their arm was being copied somewhat more faithfully from the adult? What exactly is being copied or imitated in this situation? Well, David relates the story of how Popper would begin his lectures on the philosophy of science with one word. He'd say to the students, Observe, and then just wait. Eventually, one of them would ask what they were supposed to be observing. Well, exactly. You need a theory first of what to observe and how before you can begin observing. This was perhaps one of Popper's deepest insights. Observation is theory-laden. And so when we are trying to replicate a meme,

### 1h 26m

we have to come at that situation with a theory to begin with. David imports this whole notion into the field of memetics. It cannot be straightforward imitation of behavior or copying. No. Rather, the child or anyone else seeking to uncover what someone else is thinking, to replicate their meme, so to speak, has to guess what is true and wait for feedback from the world. A child might very well be able to guess. Upon being waved at, run over towards a person and need to be corrected at some point by a parent who helps them learn, You don't need to run over there when someone waves at you. You can just stand here and move your hand or something like that. Anyway, the child guesses what is correct and eventually they get it. Apes and parrots can ape and parrot, but they cannot construct knowledge like humans can. Although they've got memes, the repertoire of their memes is fixed by their genes, but their brains are sufficiently evolved so that they can change the sequence of the memes that are fixed in many different ways. It's rather like they've got a hundred pieces of a puzzle

### 1h 27m

which can be arranged in perhaps thousands of different ways to do different things. So from the outside, it kind of looks a little like they're creating knowledge. However, the repertoire is fixed. The number of possible combinations is fixed. This explanation for how lower animals, like apes, imitate behaviors like sounds and even sign language is called behavior parsing. So it kind of looks like what we're doing, our thinking, our creativity. It was discovered by the animal behavior theorist Richard Byrne and it requires no actual creativity on the part of the ape or the parrot of the explanatory type. But humans are different. We invent new puzzle pieces all the time and so our repertoire of possible behaviors is unbounded. It is not fixed by genetics. We flew that coop long ago. Our most evolution goes on outside the genes. Genetic evolution was just a prelude. Most of the rest of the history of evolution in our universe will be about the evolution of memes.

### 1h 28m

My key takeaway from this chapter is that for most of human history, people were using their creativity in order to simply keep things the same. And they were doing this because the way to be more accepted in a static society is to be more conformist, to be more obedient. But in a dynamic society, the way to stand out is to innovate and to be creative. Chapter 17 Unsustainable Static societies reveal an important truth. If criticism is not valued by a society, it will go extinct. The parable of the Easter Islanders is salient here. They built great monuments for no more purpose than appeasing their superstitions. As whatever tragedy, disease or famine or some other natural disaster befell them, the rate of their monument building increased. They failed to try something new, to criticize the way things were done. So they went extinct. Over and over again, lost civilizations are testament to not solving their problems in time.

### 1h 29m

We are unique because we value criticism. But it is a tradition of criticism, and so we have to be careful that the institutions that preserve that tradition likewise are protected. So we are making progress fast and slow, in fits and starts, and it has been unrelenting for a time. But it's not inevitable. We need resources to build it, energy to fuel it. David Attenborough and other naturalists have gifted the world with a deep misconception over many decades now. And that misconception is that something like the tragedy of Easter Island is an example of their having consumed the resources there in an unsustainable way. But this is false. It is false because the island could never sustain them in the first place. The island was always a death trap. It had not enough trees that grew not fast enough. It had insufficient arable land, too little drinking water. Storms hit them. Drought hit them. What they had of crops

### 1h 30m

routinely destroyed by weather or pests. Bacteria and worse got into their water supply when it did rain. It was a hell hole. And if they knew how to sail elsewhere to somewhere with more resources, more pleasant, they would have done so. Or if they knew how to use the resources already there, perhaps more importantly, they would have survived. Nothing is a resource after all until the knowledge of how to use it as such is discovered. Resources are plentiful. The Earth cannot sustain us into the indefinite future. The lesson of Easter Island is that we need to make progress faster. We need more energy and cheap energy, not less. We should be optimistic that problems are soluble. There are many, many problems ahead of us. Climate change is one of them. If we want to survive here, or whatever we eventually will discover is way worse than climate change, we must have more wealth. Wealth we define as the repertoire of physical transformations we are capable of making. To have more wealth, we should be seeking out more

### 1h 31m

and cheaper resources and exploiting them. If we have insufficient wealth, when the proverbial asteroid or even worse virus eventually does arrive, we will not be sustained by anything else but our wealth. All we've got is our knowledge. That unique capacity that the laws of physics allows in us to understand anything out there in the universe and thus solve any problem we try to. Throughout the decades, people have drawn incorrect guesses about the future, which we call prophecies, that suggest doom is coming. They say the world is entering a new ice age. Presently we are told we are entering a period of warming. While we should take seriously the explanations of the experts on these matters when they are brought to us, we should also keep in mind that slowing progress and reducing wealth by concentrating it in the hands of authorities is not a solution. It does not create rapid knowledge growth and progress. To solve a problem, we need knowledge and that knowledge could come from anywhere. It could come from a child presently struggling to learn to read in an impoverished country somewhere

### 1h 32m

if only they had very cheap electricity and semiconductors. That child could be interacting on the web with people learning to read far more rapidly and eventually learning the physics needed for him or her to solve the problem of climate change quickly and efficiently. Perhaps by uncovering what it takes to make electricity from fusion reactors more cheaply. We cannot know that this is not the case. Who knows what resources are yet to be discovered and which will make many of our present political discussions moot in light of a new fuel source or way to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. It was once said that the only way for a colour television to work was with phosphors and the red phosphor-acquired europium supplies were finite on earth and so it was a mathematical certainty that colour television would eventually be a thing of the past once the europium was consumed. But no one now uses europium for the production of red pixels on screens. We use LCD technology. The lesson here should not be lost

### 1h 33m

on anyone. The growth of knowledge is unpredictable and so we should have a stance of optimism with regards to what people can actually achieve when left to their own creative capacity to learn how to do what they want to do. The key takeaway from this chapter is that nothing is a resource until the knowledge of why it is has been discovered. It is only knowledge that changes rocks into pure metals or uranium ore into electricity. Chapter 18 The Beginning It is sometimes claimed we are near the end of discovering everything that is to be discovered. That not merely is the human mind finite in scope but the very laws of physics themselves and even the prevailing view under Newtonian physics at the end of the 19th century. It was thought Newton was lucky to have uncovered the laws of physics. Einstein and his relativity and Einstein and his quantum theory and the quantum theory of lots of other people showed that impulse wrong. But it has not

### 1h 34m

gone away. John Horgan wrote a book called The End of Science which captures the mood of many scientists and even physicists. There isn't much more to know about the future of science than what we are all aware of. The world is now a place where all the forces of science are unified and then we will have an equation for printing on a t-shirt that will be able to predict everything that happens anywhere forever in principle. Or once we have a complete understanding of what is going to happen in the future. It also says we aren't error prone but our fallibility means that we will never have perfect knowledge. Error is simply a part of us and our knowledge and this is wonderful. It means error correction must go on forever.

### 1h 35m

It means there can be no final theory and so progress has no wall before it beyond which no further discovery is possible. Why is G the value it is? Why does it have that strength? Why is that law the one that operates in our universe and not something else? What is the theory that explains the physics we have discovered? We will want to go deeper. Are there actually other universes with other physical laws? In what sense were other laws even possible? If they are possible where are they? If not possible why not? Our future understandings can rule out some bad ideas now. For example quantum theory is not fully understood whatever that can mean fully. There can be no fully. Nevertheless some people have postulated that because we live in a multiverse we might be immortal. This is on the theory that should you die in this universe that you occupy you persist in the others. The problem with this is we don't understand

### 1h 36m

the place of consciousness in the multiverse exactly for a start and besides if you are a person who did not did not just commit quantum suicide or just plain old suicide why should you then suddenly become the person that did? A person that survives quantum suicide presumably does so because they never actually did commit suicide. That person who actually did commit suicide they are no longer part of this strange thought experiment. We don't know enough. We can also rule out living in a matrix or Plato's cave or being deceived by Descartes demon or that we are simply dreaming reality into existence. The most recent famous example that is logically equivalent to all of these is of course Bostrom's simulation argument which says that in the future people will build super computers on which whole universes or even whole multiverses will be simulated and those will outnumber the number of base realities presumably there is just one of those so we should presume to be in a simulation.

### 1h 37m

We can become superhuman we already are compared to the ancients and those people drawing in caves we can go on extending our lives and extending our reach. My key take away for this chapter is a special one it's simply quoting the last three sentences of the book quote There is only one way of thinking that is capable of making progress or of surviving in the long run and that is the way of seeking good explanations through creativity and criticism. What lies ahead of us in any case is infinity. All we can choose is whether it is an infinite or an infinite universe. All we can choose is whether it is an infinity of ignorance or of knowledge right or wrong death or life end quote. Well there we go that is my omnibus episode going through all 18 chapters of the beginning of infinity in 99 minutes and all because I still continue to regard this book as the most groundbreaking book

### 1h 38m

of the 21st century I can't claim to have read all the books from the 20th century but some might be there at the top of that particular century and we don't know what is coming next either maybe David's next book. Throughout my podcast series I still plan on referring more to the beginning of infinity and next episode we will have the complete interview episode 100 between myself and David Deutsch and then episodes 101 and 102 Ask Me Anything episodes as well so there is a lot to come on the theme of the work of David Deutsch of infinity and associated ideas but until next time bye bye
