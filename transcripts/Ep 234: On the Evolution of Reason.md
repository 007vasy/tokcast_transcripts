How did reason arise? Should we believe in belief? Must there have been an Adam, a first person, an initial creative creature who could reason, that first made the jump to universality and the new kind of rationality? Can I make a defense of the role of confidence, degrees of belief and weight of evidence in epistemology? All that and a lot more. Welcome to TopCast, live from Hollywood, Los Angeles, United States. Okay, so it's not live but I am indeed coming to you from the cultural center of the universe I suppose, in some senses anyway. TopCast, live from Hollywood, Los Angeles, United States. Okay, so it's not live but I am indeed coming to you from the cultural center of the universe I suppose, in some senses anyway. Humans are unique, just like every other species is unique.

### 1m

Someone was told over and again by renowned cosmologist and physicist Charlie Lineweaver when we met up and hung out last year for a few days. It's a nice quip for those who think certain human beings, like me, are somehow engaged in a kind of hubris. Namely, we think we are just so special when actually all creatures have adaptations especially and in some cases uniquely suited to the biological niches in which they find themselves. But, humans are unique, unlike the way in which every other species is unique, precisely because our biological niche is not a particular forest or desert, it is not even the plains of Africa or wherever else our ancestors began. It is not the cities and towns we have built around us. Our biological niche just so happens to be the universe, the entirety of physical reality and the reason for that is our species is no longer molded by the environment. With other

### 2m

species, conditions become more dry during a drought and there is a gradual migration of genes through a gene pool killing off those genes not suited to a deficit of water. What survives are the genes for the new dry environment and so the species change, molded as it were, by the conditions around it. But not humans, not anymore. We change the environment around us. We've begun to understand it because we can explain it and because we can explain it, we can control it. But how did this capacity to explain, understand, control and mold the environment around us arise? Was it there in primitive form in our ancestor species? Yes. So does that mean there is a continuum of intelligence of the kind we have down through the phylogenetic tree so to speak, through chimpanzees and monkeys to lesser mammals and then birds and reptiles to fish and crustaceans, insects and amoebas? Or is it just anything with a nervous system? If so, what is it about the nervous system

### 3m

that would grant a creature the capacity to explain? These are questions I have explored at length here on TopCast and regular listeners may well be tired of me beating the same unconscious horse. I have said before that although our physical anatomy is, when set beside other organisms, especially other complex animals on planet earth, nothing special. Our skeletons, nothing special. Our skin, hair, teeth, arms and legs, nothing special. Our skin, hair, teeth, arms and legs, nothing special. Our skin, hair, teeth, arms and legs, nothing special. Our skin, hair, teeth, arms and legs, nothing special. Our skin, hair, teeth, arms and legs, nothing special. Our skin, hair, teeth, arms and legs, nothing special. Our skin, hair, teeth, arms and legs, nothing special. Those biological features are on a continuum with other creatures that have evolved on this planet. But there is something special about our brains. Although to be more precise still, our minds. An often quoted figure is something like 2%. We are apparently 2% genetically different from chimpanzees. Or as it's usually put, this means we are 98% the same as chimpanzees. And so here people like to make the move too, therefore we're not. Therefore, we're nothing special. This 98% figure by the way comes from a study conducted in 1975 by King and Wilson who looked at similar protein coding regions on the DNA and they

### 4m

just said, well it looks like there's only a 1-2% difference. More recent techniques sometimes quote something more precise, a difference of 1.2%. Now there are many problems with this, not least of which is this comparison can only be made where there is a direct 1-1 correlation between the genomes. Normally this part of the genome codes for X, say spine length, in both of the genomes that you are comparing. But there is far more to genomes than this. There exist many differences between chimpanzee and human genomes which cannot be directly compared. The 1.2% figure therefore is misleading and there is no simple way to compare the genome of one species to another and report how similar one species is to another on that basis. Take one simple fact in this situation. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. But chimps have 24 pairs. And that difference alone can wildly swamp the 1.2% figure which

### 5m

glosses over it. And what really are we measuring anyway when we measure this difference between genomes? So let us put all that aside and grant the fact there is a 1.2% difference genetically between humans and chimpanzees. Now let us assume that of this 1.2% rather a lot of that is about coding for proteins that build different musculoskeletal structures, internal organs, hair on the body, all the physical things that are rather obvious. Now here we can only wildly speculate, but given that 1.2% genetic difference and given the obvious phenotypical difference which means the differences in physical appearance, what proportion of the 1.2% remains to account for the qualitative difference in our mental capacities? That 1.2% has to cover a lot of ground after all because chimpanzees and humans simply are very different. Even if we were overly conservative. And grant a full half of that 1.2% namely 0.6% being devoted to coding for a brain

### 6m

so different it can invent romance, romanticism, romanian geometry, range rovers and rockets. Chimpanzees scratch in the dirt and swing through trees. So somehow in this 0.6% strand of DNA, somehow, somewhere is a jump to universality. Why aren't chimpanzees doing just a little bit of geometry? Making smaller rockets? No, they do nothing of the sort. And they do nothing because there is no continuum. There is a leap, a jump, a discrete difference between cannot explain the rest of physical reality and can explain the rest of physical reality. We don't know what makes the difference exactly, but it is encoded in the DNA and that code is for a brain structure that runs a mind that can bootstrap its way to improving itself without bound. Which is to say, create ideas that allow for the creation of egos. That's what we want. Even better ideas, faster. Or more succinctly perhaps, error detection and correction in explanations.

### 7m

Now we admit, I say again, we do not know how any of this happened. But that there was a transition from organisms that cannot explain the physical world they evolved in to organisms like us who can explain the physical world they evolved in means there must have been the evolutionary equivalent of Adam, a first person. But that person would not have known they were a person. That person would have been the first person to know that there was such and such a thing. Of course, again, it might be the case for reasons I do not know, that there was some kind of level between completely unable to explain anything whatsoever, like a bat cannot explain anything, through to some sort of thing that could explain some things sometimes. Perhaps Australopithecus or some other ancient hominid wasn't exactly universal. To me that question is sort of of marginal interest and a task for present and future paleontologists to help explain. It's just an interesting question. Thanks very much for your time, everyone. We'll be back with you in just a moment. Bye bye. and a better understanding of what this universal capacity for explanation entails. But if there were levels of understanding between can't explain at all,

### 8m

and can explain everything that can be explained, which is where we are, that does not refute the claim there was an Adam, or the functional equivalent thereof. Or perhaps there were Adams. Perhaps they had brothers and sisters. In any case, there was this leap from non-universality to universality. And by the way, I'm not assuming Adam's gender there. In any case, after this jump to explanatory universality, the first Adam, nothing much changed. David Deutsch has explained in The Beginning of Infinity why this was so. Humans evolved the capacity to explain the world, improve the world, and make progress, and for perhaps a million years our ancestors never did. They basically did nothing with this capacity. Perhaps the first Adams were raised by non-Adam hominids, and simply did what they did by learning from them. While they, the non-Adams around them for some generations, did what they did because they were driven by pure instinct,

### 9m

and a more or less complex set of fixed means, controlling how they would seek out water, or hunt, or make basic tools, or interact socially. Our very first humans, which of course were not homo sapiens but some ancestor creative creature, simply aped, for want of a better word, what the apes around them were doing. Only then, Only their minds were different to that of the actual non-creative apes around them. But they had no means of knowing they were different. Then perhaps something happened. Perhaps the proverbial great flood did come, or the equivalent thereof. The non-creative apes did what they always did. They relied upon their existing memes and the instincts gifted to them by evolution and failed to survive. But the first humans, well, they could imagine a future as the waters began to rise and just perhaps one looked off to the horizon and saw higher ground and reasoned that if they made for that place quick smart, they would survive, and they did. They guessed something the other apes, their cousins and possibly parents, could not.

### 10m

And they lived while the species from which they evolved went extinct. And so the story of humanity began, and the story of epistemology. Perhaps the one who urged the others to make the trek was designated a chief and he or she or they were thought of as having space. Special powers. And from then on, generation after generation, their sons were granted the authority to direct the tribe. And so deference to authority, not too unlike what happens in non-human animal hierarchies, began with the alpha males and females being obeyed out of fear of violence or worse. And so epistemology likely began in such an authoritarian manner where we simply agreed with the chief or medicine man out of fear of violence. This, over millennia, was somewhat improved by organised religion. Why was that an improvement over purely tribal societies? Well, for one thing, the violence was not as common. Still common by today's standards, sure, but at least commandments, laws, rules began to be enforced.

### 11m

Some claimed a monopoly on violence. Constant rape and outright murder was shunned in large part compared with our prehistoric ancestors. And literacy began, even if only for the elite. Texts could be created and debated. Discussions and interpretations of myth began. And competing authorities might even, from time to time, improve what was in those books or how those books might be read. The individual might even be given reasons, sometimes even good, for why they should do this or that or expect punishment. It might no longer simply be at the whim of the chief. Rather, mindless obedience was still, of course, expected. But the lowly classes at least could imagine that the reason they had to conform was not because the chief or priest simply said so, but rather, there was an objective, transcendent truth of the matter. God, or the gods, or nature itself, willed it to be so, and the priest or king merely the vessel or mouthpiece of a power greater still.

### 12m

All of this was actually an improvement, even if it does not seem so from our lofty place in our Enlightenment. But the choice between prehistoric, brutish, animalistic, near constant chaos, and the tyranny of organised, ancient and even medieval religion is an easy one to make for any who think, for a moment, what the difference was really like. And of course, no one is ever mindless in either society. It is just that in some, the circle of concern and cooperation is much greater. Multiple tribes, for example, need not be at constant war with one another, but rather can gather under the umbrella of a single ideology, forming larger social groups. And together, they may even make some progress sometimes, even if it was almost stagnant. Most of the time, by any modern measure of such things. Early organised societies, governed by some religious ideology, were markedly different from purely tribal ones, even in their physical manifestation in the world, as well as the social.

### 13m

It was a world where great stone and mortar churches, temples, castles or pyramids were built, as compared with the brutish conditions of straw hut and cave life. Now, beyond this, an escape from that kind of authoritarianism, religious and almost purely tyrannical, authoritarianism, came the anti-tyrannical, purportedly anti-authority stances of empiricism, inductivism, rationalism, instrumentalism and more. Early British and Continental Enlightenment figures pushed back against what was basically the believe this thing on the authority of the king or the priest, or because it is so decreed in the holy book, with the stance of instead, use your own senses and reason to gather evidence or recount an argument to convince yourself. Take no one's word for it, so to speak. That is an improvement. It is an improvement to say that single book and that man in the special hat do not have all the answers.

### 14m

Perhaps no one has all the answers, but you can gather some answers sometimes. Rely on yourself, rely on your senses and your mind. And if you are careful, then you can collect lots of evidence and be more confident that the book might be wrong and the priest in the tall hat might not in fact be telling you the truth. Your mind, if you are careful, can lead you to truth. The Bible or your other holy book does not contain all of the truth or the final truth most of the time. You yourself, your mind can reason its way to beliefs that might be at odds with what the religions you were brought up in the tradition of tend to teach. Empiricism is the idea that we can observe the world and from our observations derive truth. We see the moon. So the moon exists. Inductivism is the idea that with repeated observations, we can derive or extract an explanation of what is happening. We see the sun rise each day and move across the sky. And from this observation, we extract the theory from nature that the earth must be rotating on its axis.

### 15m

And the more often we see the same thing day after day, the more confident we become that the explanation is true. Rationalism is the idea that our careful application of reason, the use of our minds, for example, in the case of inductively concluding such and such a theory is true, is indeed true. That reason, when carefully applied, cannot go wrong. For reason is like logic, pristine and perfect, a mathematical ideal. Instrumentalism is the idea that the reason we do any of this is so we can reliably predict the future or use our theories, such as the theory that the earth spins on its axis, to be confident that tomorrow the sun will indeed rise, or rather appear once again and will continue to do so. Indeed, we do not even necessarily have to be committed to the reality of the sun or the earth or anything else on instrumentalism. But we can say we will observe day to be followed by night or darkness following light because of our explanation.

### 16m

Now, each of these ideas, preferable though they are to just believe what is in the holy book or what the holy man says about the contents of the holy book and obey him. Ultimately, even these ideas of empiricism, inductivism, and instrumentalism, and that sort of rationalism, are all appeals to authority. They focus on the source of some kind of information and seek to say of that source, in much the same way that the religious people point to the Bible as an inerrant source of truth and say, here, this thing, not the book or the pope or the king. No, this thing is the ultimate or perhaps most reliable source of truth. It is your senses, that's empiricism, or it's your mind, that's rationalism. But rationalism of that kind, that your mind can deliver you the truth, the final inerrant truth about all of reality or even any small matter, is the misconception of confusing the subject matter with our knowledge of the subject matter.

### 17m

Reason and reasoning may involve logic from time to time and the rules of inference, for example, knowing that contradictions are not a good thing. One should not endorse the idea that you are both listening to me right now and simultaneously you are not listening to me right now. That is incoherent. That is a logical claim. But there is a difference between the perfection of logical ideals, which is to say something like there is a difference between the subject matter of mathematics, which is necessary truth, and our knowledge of mathematics. The number two is an abstract ideal, as I have said many times before. But any representation of it as a numeral, even speaking the word number two, only imperfectly captures that thing. The next highest prime number exists and there will always be a next highest prime number, because proofs beginning with Euler in around 300 B.C. attest to the reality of the infinite set of prime numbers. At any time, we only know of a finite number and always will.

### 18m

But all those other primes yet to be discovered really do exist. They are the subject matter of mathematics, which is different to our knowledge of mathematics. The fundamental constituents of the physical world is the subject matter of particle physics. But it's not a reward we get for doing particle physics. The reward we get is knowledge of particles, which tend to get ever smaller. The more we probe with ever larger particle accelerators and so on. So we began in a circumstance where we were taught to simply obey the tribal chieftains or else we die from some silly accident or be put to death for disobedience or otherwise hurt severely. For this is how our ancestor animals behaved and still do. The alpha males and females tolerate no challenge to their authority. The incremental improvement upon that was for a system of ethics and social organization to be codified into holy books designated in many cases to be the word of the creator or creators of the universe and inerrant text to be interpreted by the authorities of priests, popes and kings whom one must believe.

### 19m

You must believe their interpretation for they believe the text as you clearly should, for it was the capital T truth. And it would be absurd not to believe the truth and the incremental improvement on that idea was for you to be told that the truth was not the sole purview or privilege of a selected elite, an authority like a book or priest or prince. No, you yourself could get to the truth by believing your senses. Seeing is believing, as we are told. And you could calibrate the strength of your beliefs given the preponderance of evidence. If you feel particularly strongly about something rationally, this should be because the evidence you have accumulated was that much greater. And so your reasons that much better truth could be found when your confidence in your beliefs approached certainty. Now, if you are even more sophisticated these days, you elevate all of that to a new epistemology. Bayesianism, where you claim the strength of the feeling you have

### 20m

corresponds to a precise number, a credence expressed as a percentage which can be updated, so they say, when the evidence changes. One updates their priors, their prior probability. This view evidence accumulates can be counted in some way or weighed and somehow a calculation performed, which gives a more or less precise measure of how confident one is or should be anywhere from zero to 100 percent. Although either of those numbers would almost be irrational and never mind how confident one is or how to calculate how confident one is, for example, about being, let's say, 20 percent confident. Should one be 90 percent confident they really are 20 percent confident of the world being destroyed by AI, for example. But notice just how authoritarian all of this is and also how mechanical a picture it paints of the creatively rational method of knowledge creation people actually do is people simply do not, as a matter of fact,

### 21m

assign probabilities to their confidence, nor can they calculate such things. When someone says they have updated their prior probability about X risk or when the AI apocalypse is going to happen 24 percent within the next decade, they are not using a calculator or a supercomputer or anything of the sort to help them with this. They never even use Bayes theorem, although they use the word. They are literally just assigning a number pulled from thin air about their general nebulous feeling on the topic. And again, it is an appeal to authority in the first instance of mathematics, as if being precise with numbers automatically grants greater credibility to their claim. For example, how fearful one is that the AI apocalypse will be upon us within the decade because the person assigning the newly calibrated number or so-called calibrated number, the degree of belief they have in what is going to happen somehow must direct their conclusions. But one's personal degree of fearfulness

### 22m

about AI has nothing whatever to do with how concerned one should actually be. Even if one is an expert, what matters is arguments, not feelings, not fears. And the reliance upon authority does not even start or end there. When empiricists managed to escape from the authoritarianism of religious thinking, God, the spirit world and the priesthood was replaced with human senses. One was told they could believe their senses as if they would not go wrong. At least in some cases, even modern day Ayn Rand objectivists endorse a version of this idea. One must believe their own reasons as if reason cannot go wrong. When reason is carefully calibrated to the evidence and so on. And all of these ideas about rationality, in fact, reduce rationality to a kind of subjectivism, that epistemology relies upon emotion in order to be rational. The more confident or certain one is, the more strongly one should believe.

### 23m

This, as I emphasize again, is preferable to giving over one's critical faculties entirely to higher authorities like priests and princes. And again, an incremental improvement may be something like Bayesianism. Update your priors, even though, as I've explained, no one actually ever calculates anything and nor can Bayesian reasoning create any new idea, but only purportedly decide between theories guessed. And as I've said many times before, it's almost never the case that we even have multiple theories on offer anyway. Take fossils. Is it really the case we need to assign probabilities to these so-called competing explanations that are, one, fossils are evidence of extinct life on Earth that evolved via processes of natural selection and preserved by a chemical and geological means which turned mud and organic matter into a rock over millions of years? Or two, a great flood around 6000 years ago drowned many species in mud and there they remain preserved in the ground. Or three, God is simply playing a trick on us.

### 24m

Or four, aliens once ruled the Earth and killed those animals with lasers that left no trace and then buried them in the ground. Or five, those fossils actually are evidence of nothing except that they are strangely patterned rocks, which our pattern seeking minds wrongly think were once actual creatures. So there we have five different theories. How do we assign probabilities to any of them? This is never our circumstance in reality because there is one explanation. The first one, the dinosaur explanation, explains the evidence that is the fossils. And should we want to really rule out the others, for example, the next best one, I suppose, the creationist idea of a flood some thousands of years ago, we can use the methods of physics, in particular, radioactive dating of some kind to age the fossils in the rocks to being older than 62 million years. That rules out all the other explanations. And in turn, the radioactive evidence is only explained by the dinosaur explanation. And no one needs to believe in dinosaurs or be confident about dinosaurs or certain

### 25m

or anything of the sort. All that is superfluous and epistemologically dubious anyways, because once we have that good explanation of fossils, then we simply say we know what fossils are. They are evidence of dinosaurs and we know it conjecturally. Could we be wrong? We could always be wrong about anything. Now, I cannot imagine how and I spend little time thinking about how I could be wrong about dinosaurs. It's just that there is an explanation of fossils and it solves many problems. But it also raises lots of interesting problems, too. Were there many other species simply not preserved? We know there were. Where are they? Is there more evidence of them somewhere? Were there more advanced species at the same time as the dinosaurs? Might they have been an intelligent species that never quite reached the stage of leaving behind civilizational artefacts on Earth? Given dinosaurs existed hundreds of millions of years ago, this means very complex creatures indeed could evolve hundreds of millions of years ago. And so therefore, might they have elsewhere in the universe?

### 26m

And might they be intelligent? We don't need to believe anything or be confident. In epistemology, what we want is knowledge. We want to know. And when we do, we want an answer, not the final answer, but an answer that works and reveals more to us. But this epistemology, which I simply call epistemology rather than some special kind of epistemology, given it is so poorly understood, so poorly known and therefore how to think rationally is so poorly understood, we want to help culture move in a direction where people can think better and more rationally when that's important. But how? Let us first concede that today most people are religious thinkers or even unthinking to some large extent on many issues. And so for them, if they simply believe the authority where the authority is a holy book or a priest or a politician, then the move to empiricism or the move to discussing evidence, the weight thereof or confidence or certainty or how emotionally attached they are to a claim

### 27m

is better than having no reason whatsoever or the implicit reason driving their behavior that I believe this because the authority says so. And so speaking to a religious thinker or a superstitious thinker or a person who is still thinking in a religious authoritarian mindset, even if they deny thinking religiously by thinking religiously, I mean someone who says they believe a thing because an authority has told them it. So there is no critical thought beyond that. In these cases, speaking about degrees of confidence is good. It raises into awareness the question of why they say they believe what they do. It asks for reasons. It asks for an explanation. Asking them how strongly they believe a thing speaks to them in their own language. Everyone or almost everyone is brought up speaking in terms of strength of belief, and therefore they begin thinking about the world in terms of things they believe with certainty, things they believe strongly, things they only slightly believe,

### 28m

things they have no opinion on, things they slightly disbelieve, disbelieve strongly or absolutely do not believe. That is the spectrum people are brought up on. But often they do not even apply that. And applying that becomes a proxy for asking a person why. Why do you believe or disbelieve that thing strongly is a path to asking the real question we are after, which is what is your explanation? And once that question is asked, everything else becomes irrelevant. At that point, the person will give a good account of themselves, provide the explanation, the explanation they know, or they will fail to do so. And if they fail to do so, then they have no rational reason why they should claim a thing in the first place. They should be neutral at best. They should say they do not know, much less believe something because they lack the ability to explain themselves.

### 29m

But if they can explain themselves, then they know. This does not mean they are right. Only that in their mind they know, and it is rational to act on the basis of what one knows. Now, few, of course, realize at this point that if someone knows a thing, this does not mean they should believe the thing. Let me thrash that dead, unconscious horse again. Newtonian gravity is known to be false. It's known not to be true, refuted by experiment. But I know it. Every physics student who has ever passed through a classical mechanics course has learned it and knows it, and they may even have been taught it's false. And so they also know it's false. To know a thing is to not know a thing is true. And therefore it cannot be a reason to believe a thing. Indeed, belief is superfluous, as I have said to this entire enterprise. But being able to give an account of one's ideas, being able to explain what one thinks is not superfluous, and that is really all that matters in rational terms.

### 30m

But all of this is my ideal and an ideal. I think all those engaged in promoting rationality should move towards. But in the meantime, asking people to justify their beliefs is a nice proxy to some extent. I think meeting people where they are, so to speak, is important, as Popper did. And given that the epistemology, Popper's epistemology, is so poorly understood, moving people into a more rational way of thinking when it matters and away from purely religious or superstitious or dogmatic thinking and authoritarian thinking into a realm of questioning their own ideas and explaining their own ideas, or having them thinking about whether indeed they do have an explanation for why they feel the way they do about something or behave the way they do or say the things they do is important and framing this in terms of feelings like confidence and certainty and belief can do good work in improving what often goes by the name of critical thinking skills again.

### 31m

And for a final time, I will say good though that is compared to the worst rivals I spoke about. And however, rational to some extent it is, I think for professionals working in this space publicly defending the Enlightenment, that it is important to keep in the back of their minds there is something better and understanding that feelings need not form a part of how to adjudicate claims or rationally engage. Or perhaps more importantly, that epistemology is much more broad than a study of just what is going on in people's minds. It can be that. It can be about what people think and why it can be about how a person uses reason, how they have created an explanation and criticized it or failed to criticize it. It can be about a person's rationality, in other words, and so on. But and let us put this in neon lights. Epistemology is about knowledge and knowledge creation.

### 32m

And knowledge, for the most part, is more than just what is inside of people's minds. It is inside of books and widgets, computers, cars and cans. It is, we say, instantiated in physical substrates. Epistemology is the study of knowledge and how it grows. And knowledge is information with causal power. It is the study of useful information. And information is useful to the extent it solves some problem. And because it solves some problem, it is therefore useful and tends to get copied. It gets itself copied. Amazing. It is information that once instantiated in a physical substrate, it tends to cause itself to remain so. It is resilient information. It is a structure in the universe that can outlast and will outlast even the most ancient rocks on planet Earth, for knowledge will self-correct. A gradually eroding rock has no means of protection against the rain, water, salt and acid, which will over time, in an accord with the second law of thermodynamics, eventually return it all to dust.

### 33m

It's basic minerals before being absorbed once again into the mantle of the Earth and metamorphosized into something new. But knowledge is not like this. Its physical substrate may decay, but it can also get copied to a new substrate, a new medium, remembered and not forgotten if it is useful enough and resilient enough. Knowledge can aim itself at a target and radically transform it. Just as the knowledge of how to create a self-sustaining civilization took aim at the Americas from Europe and transformed the northern part of that continent into the most dynamic and most wealthy civilization to have ever existed, at least in this corner of the universe. And from here, the knowledge will continue to transform the Earth and then the solar system and possibly the galaxy, turning useless matter into resources that construct a civilization for people. And all of that is what epistemology is about, how knowledge grows and transforms. Yes, people are knowledge creators, but epistemology is about more than just the strength of their beliefs, if it is even about that at all.

### 34m

Either people know a thing or they do not, and that is the binary that a rational person should be cognizant of, and cognizant of raising into consciousness for people who continue to think that even where they do not know a thing, they should have an opinion or belief about it anyway. Perhaps slightly believe something they actually know nothing about. But why? What is the rational thing to do when one does not know? It is to seek an answer, not take a stance to defend before one actually knows. That way leads to tribal thinking. Of course, if all of society behind us behaves in a particular way, that can be a reason to follow the herd at times. Not all herd following is bad because often culture is wiser than the individuals within it. Traditions do contain knowledge, often inexplicit. But in that case, you know, you know what to do because society has told you to do a thing, even if at times you cannot make it explicit.

### 35m

For example, our dynamic societies contain within them knowledge about how to sustain rapid change while remaining stable. That knowledge cannot be made fully explicit. We don't know all the reasons why we can accelerate so quickly while at the same time not fall into chaos. Our society is becoming more stable over time, which is to say more peaceful and joyful and fun and wealthy, while also changing ever more rapidly as knowledge is created at an ever increasing rate. That is a civilizational or even cosmic view of epistemology. And of that, what is going on in people's minds in terms of the strength of their conviction is perhaps at best a footnote to that entire grand division of epistemology. But you may be uninspired by all of this as if I am taking all emotion out of epistemology. Not quite. We can be curious and should be interested and excited. So, yes, people are emotional and people feel convinced by a good argument or feel

### 36m

the evidence is a valid refutation. But this is just to say that when we reason it happens in our minds and we are conscious, of course we are. And so reason feels a particular way. But this is not to say that reason is a feeling. If it is, it is more than just a feeling. It is a method of error detection and correction. And it has no bounds. If reason is a feeling, then it is a feeling against which we can judge all other feelings and indeed all other things. But even if we were to concede reason as a feeling, that is a far cry from saying we should therefore decide based on the strength of feeling that we have or the confidence we have or how strongly we claim to believe a thing. No, we should decide given a good explanation. And rather often it is the only explanation or else we simply do not know a thing. I recently had the wonderful opportunity to meet and befriend some of those involved with spectrum street epistemology.

I want to say up front that like so many rationalists, my new friends and allies in the fight to defend the Enlightenment in the street epistemology movement are doing fantastic work. Very few out there are doing such explicit outreach on a daily basis to raise awareness about critical thinking through the lens of contemporary issues in a fun way. Street epistemology brings into collective and individual consciousness the reasons people have for endorsing a claim. This is often something few even ever think about. And if that means moving people away from religious and dogmatic thinking or even unthinking attitudes into a mode of explaining or in their words, justifying the degree of their confidence in a claim given the weight of evidence, then so be it. That is God's work and it's good. But of course, I wish to raise to consciousness a move beyond God's work to a higher plane still, or perhaps a deeper, more fundamental way to understand

epistemology as an actual study of something like the physics of knowledge or at least the nascent science and physics of epistemology and the fundamental moral claim to not destroy the means of error correction. I want the street epistemologists to also appreciate the idea that really focusing on strength of feeling or belief or confidence or certainty misses the point. Your real objective is to discuss and uncover what explanation a person has for agreeing or not with some claim they either know the topic and have decided. Rationally, or they do not. And if they do know about it, then how strongly they feel about what they know is irrelevant. After all, at that point, they know they have a good, to them at least, explanation why they agree or disagree with some claim. If they lack a good explanation, then the only rational thing is to be neutral. A hunch simply means they do not know. But it is in that case not rational to slightly agree.

They might say, I know, but I can't explain why. I simply have an intuition. This may be rational because they may have experiences they cannot recall. Or it may be irrational. But the point here is that there is no way of distinguishing those cases, even to themselves. And if the stakes are high, they really should say they do not know. Now, as part of my meetings with the street epistemology people, I also got to participate in what Karl Popper would have called fruitful discussions with people who occupied very different frameworks or who held very different worldviews. Those worldviews were, I would suggest in some cases, even opposed to the Enlightenment in fundamental ways. And in large part, this was because they likely had never even considered the question of how they came to know what they knew and why. Or why, in their words, they really, truly believed what they believed. Even in the case of internet personality, commentator and influencer Destiny, Stephen Bonnell, though we differed markedly on some fundamentals, I was surprised at how often we actually agreed.

And how receptive he was to criticism and willing to engage in discussion. He may have seen our encounter as a debate, but I saw it as a fun exchange of ideas. Our discussion should be published soon. There exist two important streams of epistemology, if you like. That concerned with knowledge broadly, all its manifestations, both its physical and abstract aspects, that is the main stream. But a tributary, if you like, of that stream, it's not really a second stream in any technical sense. It's that part of epistemology concerned with how people think. This is a very special and more narrow case and really, in large part, the domain of psychology. But epistemology can absorb this part of psychology. I happen to be interested in both and I want to understand how to marry them. After all, much of this thing about how people think is about how they create explanations, knowledge and how they critique them.

I want to first thank Reid and Peter. To Peter for having perhaps the most Popperian response to a criticism I've ever encountered for a long time as I explained why his endorsement of Richard Dawkins' Middle World and Haldane's Queerer Than We Can Suppose idea is completely false. I'm unsure if I've yet convinced him he is wrong, but our discussions continue. Reid's knowledge of Deutsch and Popper is as deep as his generosity in supporting my participation in his street epistemology events. Helping to promote my own work through my involvement with Peter's channel. The other members of the street epistemology crew, David, Evan, Travis, Ellen and Nora, all of whom I met briefly, but was so much fun to spend time with. And to Mia Hughes for an interesting discussion about some hot topics of our time. And finally, to the Nice Wonder family, without whose generosity these productions could not only not have run so smoothly,

but likely would never have happened at all. Support for this kind of enlightenment outreach wouldn't happen at all without backing. And on that note, thanks once again, as always, to Naval Ravikant for his ongoing support of these ideas. Until next time. Bye bye.
