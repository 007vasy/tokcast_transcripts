Welcome to TockCast. I'm Brett Hall and this is episode 215 of TockCast. Today I'm doing one of those quite rare episodes where I actually talk to someone else rather than having a soliloquy. And today I'm speaking with someone I've known for over 25 years. He was once a lecturer of mine at the University of New South Wales where he lectured me on physics. Actually it was more an astrobiology course. We'll get to that. But even after I graduated from the first degree that I did, I became fascinated by his back catalogue. And he's been mentioned before on TockCast many times just because there are so many parts of his research that in fact come to bear on the kind of things that David Deutsch talks about. Because in both cases, although they're coming from quite different philosophies, traditions and worldviews, nonetheless, because they're interested in fundamental aspects of

### 1m

what it is that life is about and the laws of physics and the place of human beings within all of this stuff, or people as we might say, there is some overlap between what Charlie Lineweaver and David Deutsch talk about. And perhaps just as importantly, they both follow the fun. Charlie seems to have... no exhaustive way of figuring out what it is he wants to do next. He seems to effortlessly change his area of interest or what he's curious about from one year to the next. And you'll hear a little bit about his life story there in the first part of the chat. And you'll also hear that, well, Charlie and I don't always agree. Or do we? We don't. And because Charlie and I have spoken at length about the issues on which we disagree in real life, I haven't recapitulated

### 2m

much of any of those disagreements here. Although you'll hear a taste of it. Anyway, the areas where we disagree aren't as interesting as those areas where I just wanted to find out from Charlie. His particular views, where I happen to align with him, because he can explain so much of these areas of astrobiology that I don't want to explain to him. And I have to say that Charlie is a very interesting person. He's a great source of information and cosmology. In a way which, well, I think the average listener will find great value in. Not least, because he is a communicator as well as a scientist of the first rate. He should be more well known, but he's just not out there on social media. Importantly, although we cover many interesting topics, there is one elephant in the room, which doesn't really get a mention at all. Charlie's... ... developed with Paul Davies. And one of the reasons that I have been vocal recently in trying to

### 3m

bring to the world's attention the existence of Charlie Lineweaver, not that he needs much help from me because he already is famous in certain circles, he needs to be more famous, because of this completely new way of trying to understand cancer. It's a new approach to curing cancer. Now, might it fail? Of course, everything could fail. But this approach is worth looking into. I, as I say in this interview, don't really touch on that because a wonderful interview was done recently between Charlie and another podcaster on that stuff. And by the way, I will be releasing a talk I had the privilege of being a part of with Charlie recently as well, where he talks about the technical details of some of this stuff. So just wait for... That to come in the TalkCast feed too soon, a talk by Charlie Lineweaver about atavistic cancer. And I've told this story on TalkCast before. I don't want to drop names, but it just happens to

### 4m

be the case. It was a curious little part of my life where I happened to be working as a science communicator for the University of New South Wales, where Charlie was my professor. And I was organising this event that was called Science in the Pub, and they just happened to be debating a panel of astronomers. And I said, well, I'm going to do this. And they said, well, I'm going to do this. And I said, well, I'm going to do this. And they said, well, I'm going to do this. And I said, well, I'm going to do this. And they said, well, I'm going to do this. And I said, well, I'm going to do this. And I said, well, I'm going to do this. What the meaning of the word planet was all about. And so anyway, they were having this fun debate and whatever else. And I was just organising the event. And who should walk into the event but the great Paul Davies. Paul Davies was, remember, any fans out there who happen to be listening to me, he was my science hero before I knew anything about David Deutsch. I was reading Paul Davies books from like the year 1992. And when I exhausted all of Paul Davies' back catalogue of books, well, what was sitting on the shelf there was a book that had been blurbed on the back by Paul Davies, which said something to the effect of, I have not been so inspired since I read Gertl Escher Bach.

### 5m

And that was a quote by Paul Davies. And that was on the back of the book called The Fabric of Reality by David Deutsch. And so to have Paul Davies walk into this pub at an event that I happen to be hosting, and to see Paul Davies come in there, it was like, I don't know, a teenager who happens to love the latest pop sensation seeing Taylor Swift walking into the venue where they happen to be. So I was so excited. And I remember going up, you know, gingerly, I was the age of 21 or something like that, maybe younger, and saying to Professor Paul Davies, you know, you're my scientific hero. I don't have one of your books here with me. But could you sign, could you autograph my lecture notes, which I happen to be carrying with me. And the lecture notes were for this. Subject that Charlie Lineweaver happened to be teaching and Paul looked on the front cover. And he said, Oh, Charlie Lineweaver, do you know Charlie Lineweaver? I said, Do I know him? He happens to be one of my lecturers. Oh, well, here's my card. And so I got Paul Davies card,

### 6m

I got two cards, I said, Could I have another one, please, Professor Davies, and I'll keep one as a souvenir for myself. But I will pass on, as you've just asked, the other one to Charlie Lineweaver. And so I like to regard myself as a very small footnote to a footnote in the history of the collaboration that began that evening, between Paul Davies and Charlie Lineweaver, who have worked on a number of different papers. And we'll talk about some of those throughout this episode with Charlie. But importantly, and recently, the stuff they've been doing on atavistic cancer research, but they also did stuff on cosmology and black holes, the shadow biosphere, we will hear about it all. I have been endlessly fascinated by the back catalogue of papers that I've written about the atavistic cancer research. And I've written about Charlie has written ever since, we will hear here about what he's working on now, what his latest interests are, as well as how he got into physics, his contribution to Nobel Prize winning research,

### 7m

and what he happens to think about some of my ideas, with which he thinks he disagrees, but I'm not sure that he really does. Although we don't explore it all here. So, optimists out there everywhere, have fun with this chat between myself, and the iconic Charlie Lineweaver. Thank you so much for joining us. We'll see you next time.

### 8m

Life story, because you didn't follow the traditional trajectory that people are assumed to go through in order to become a professional scientist, a cosmologist, who is contributing to some really groundbreaking fundamental research. You found yourself in soccer boots at some point, and then teaching Japanese people English. So explain to me how those things somehow led you to working on... And research that actually led to a Nobel Prize. Okay, that's a long question. You're asking my entire history of my life. How about we just stick to the fact that you didn't do undergraduate physics straight out of high school, you went and did English.

### 9m

It goes back, I think, to, I guess, an identity crisis. I think everybody has at least some version of an identity crisis. I had a strong one in high school. I didn't know what I wanted to become, except that I had a sense of cultural claustrophobia. I knew I was being fed a bunch of stuff about America. I grew up in America, in New York. I was born in North Carolina, grew up in New York, in a place called Northport, New York. And I just had the feeling that I was being, I was claustrophobic culturally, so I wanted to travel. As a matter of fact, when I first applied to Brown University as an undergraduate, they said, oh, look at this, this is a, we were the state champions in soccer, and I was the center, not the center forward, the midfielder. And so I was going to go to Brown. I went to Brown University based on a soccer scholarship, but they asked me, oh, so what do you want to study, by the way? And I said, well, I'm not sure, but I know I want to take a junior year abroad. And they heard that and they said, okay, we don't need this guy.

### 10m

He's obviously more committed to traveling abroad than to the soccer. Anyway, so I always had this strong sense of a cultural identity crisis and not knowing who I was, but I wanted to be a man of a world somehow. And I was always good at school, but I never paid much attention to it in high school. You know, I was, I was one of these people who thought it was, it was cool not to study, you know, and, and do really well on exams without studying. So that was my, my, my misguided youth until I got to university when I said, hey, I like this stuff, finding out stuff. But I did do a junior year abroad. I was an old American soccer player at the State University of New York at Binghamton. And then I did a junior year abroad. I went to the University of Ile-Ife in Nigeria. Why? Because of the sense of cultural claustrophobia. And then I realized that I couldn't speak English. Most Americans think they can speak English. And so I was one of them. And then I realized, wait a minute, I can't write very well. I can't speak very well. And so I said, I better study English. So I went back and, and I majored in history and English at the State University of New York at Binghamton because, mostly because they had the best teachers there.

### 11m

They had the teachers in the history and the English departments were by far better than the ones in science, although I love science. So I studied English and history. And then I went to Brown University to study English. And then I went to Brown University to study English. And then I went to Brown University to study English. And did creative writing after a year. And then when I was in West Africa, oh, I forgot. When I was in Nigeria, I then got kicked out because there was a coup d'etat and I didn't have a proper visa. I had a tourist visa rather than a student visa. So then I hitchhiked around West Africa with my then girlfriend, went to Dakar and went to Timbuktu and crossed the Sahara in a goat truck. And then I got a scholarship to study Egyptian studies in Alexandria. So that's what I did. I studied a lot of history and I majored in world history and English. And then I went to graduate school at Brown University in English. But then after a year, I said, hey, I want to learn French better because I saw all those people who are speaking French in West Africa.

### 12m

So I'm going to speak French. And so I went to the Allianz Francaise in Paris for a year and then went back to Brown, graduated. Then I went to, no, not, no. Then I went to Munich and studied, started studying physics. Undergraduate. Now, why did you pick physics at that time? It seems like a strange, sudden turn from languages to science. Well, I realized, this is a profound realization, that when you study history or when you study English, you're studying the, basically the culture of one small fraction of humanity. And so I wasn't becoming a man of the world. I was becoming a Western man. And I didn't want that to happen. I wanted to study something that everybody in the whole world would respect. And I was always good in physics. That was one of the things I loved the most about high school. And so then I said, I'm going to study physics and play soccer. So that's what I did in Germany. And so that's where I began my undergraduate physics career. Then I continued that in Japan. After three years in Germany, I went to Japan for three years, studied Japanese and studied physics.

### 13m

And then I guess an interesting story is that while I was in Japan, I wanted to study for the GRE exam in physics. And so I got the, I was teaching English there. Almost every Westerner. I was a Westerner who lives in Japan, teaches English for money. And so I did that, but I had the advantage of teaching English to physicists. And what I got was I got the GRE study book. And I said, you guys are physicists and I want to learn this stuff and I can teach you English. So why don't you explain to me in your broken English what the physics of these questions is? And so basically I was getting paid to study for the GREs. I thought that was a very good, it was almost like a hundred dollars an hour or something. Anyways. A lot. And I thought, this is great. I'm getting paid to study what I'm supposed to do anyway. So then I, then I went to enter the PhD program in physics at Berkeley. And after two years, this was in 1987, two years later, I passed the qualifying exams.

### 14m

And then I saw a notice on the board said, hey, something about the cosmic background explorer. And looking at the microwave background, I said, whoa, that sounds interesting. So I went up to George Smoot's lab and applied and, and I was accepted. And then for the next five years or so, we studied the fluctuations in the microwave background. And for that, that discovery of these fluctuations, when I say fluctuations, in other words, you look at that, these are the oldest photons you can see. You're essentially look at the photosphere of the universe, looking at redshift, not of one, two or 10, but redshift of a thousand. And so these are the oldest photons you can see. If you look in any direction, you will see this radiation. It's the background radiation. And essentially George Smoot has said, it's like looking at the face of God or something. The idea is that the structure we see in the universe around us had to have had seeds very early on that could grow gravitationally. Those seeds had to have been there at the time of this microwave radiation.

### 15m

We, no one had seen the hot and cold spots, which would correspond to the seeds until this COBE satellite and particularly one instrument on board the COBE satellite, the differential microwave radiometer. And George Smoot was the principal investigator of that. And I was his only PhD student at that time. So. I worked very closely with George, but there was another, a whole big group that worked on this and you go ahead. But the, the basic problem was that we knew that the temperature of the cosmic microwave background was everyone throws around that number 2.7 and it was smooth. It was uniform, but that was known. But the mystery was that the rest of the universe was lumpy. And what you found was in fact, lumpiness in the CMB. Is that right? And you personally were responsible for the processing of the data. And was it you who slipped it under his door or was there some story there? Well, there was quite a big group and a lot of people deserve credit. You know, when these people get Nobel prizes, they're often members of groups, but George really, he got a Nobel prize with John Mather.

### 16m

Both of them deserved the Nobel prize, but there were big teams behind each of these guys. I was, like I said, the only PhD student that George had, he, but he had several other people programming and then he had a whole big, big team in the, on the East coast. That, um, but we were talking, I'm talking about Berkeley. Uh, and so, yes, there, we, we knew that there was structure locally, what we also, so far, the microwave background seemed to be perfectly one temperature, but we knew there had to be fluctuations at a certain level, 10 to the minus three or 10 to the minus four, 10 to the minus five and bingo, we found these fluctuations at 10 to the minus five, but it required quite a lot of calibration, quite a lot of subtraction of the foreground from our galaxy that, you know, there are synchrotron radiation. There's free, free radiation. So basically the, my PhD was called the correlation function. And so, uh, I made, uh, uh, one or two of the, the, uh, diagrams in our most famous 1992 paper in which we announced the discovery of the, uh, fluctuations in the background, which Stephen Hawking called the greatest discovery of the century, if not of all time.

### 17m

Um, I think one way to understand why he said that is because we were looking at angular scales that we saw structure that was so big that it could not have been. Causally determined. So one side of this is let's say there's a big hotspot. That hotspot was so big that one side did not know about the other, so it had to have been produced, uh, in a epic called inflation, where you could have causal connection between those two sides of the hotspot. Uh-huh. And today, we're still studying the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. I mean, after the cosmic background explorer that you worked on. Uh. Then there was WMAP, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. And then there was Planck. I don't know if there's a fourth one out there now. Each one more high resolution than the last. But can you explain why do we do this? Why are we finding ever more precise temperature differentials between one cold spot and one warm spot next to each other?

### 18m

What can that tell us about deep mysteries of the universe? Well, just imagine you're an archaeologist and you're looking for the origin of humanity. And what you want is to look at, you know, I guess Neanderthals and our early ancestors 300,000 years ago. And then you look at Homo erectus. You look at Australopithecines. In other words, if you want to find out how we got here, we need to know the history of how we got here. Now, if you apply that on the largest scale, we're talking about how did the universe get to be here? Why is there something rather than nothing, for example, is one question that's sometimes asked. And so you have to find the earliest evidence you can for your model of the universe. And the microwave background is the earliest evidence we have. It's a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years after the Big Bang, which is less than half a million years.

### 19m

So that's very, very young. Now, there are other ways to probe even deeper. For example, if we had a neutrino telescope, we could see much closer to the Big Bang. And presumably in maybe, I don't know, 20, 30, 40 years, we will have gravitational telescopes that might be sensitive enough to look even further back in time. The reason why that's important is because we need to probe the earliest epochs about 10 to the minus 9 seconds after the Big Bang because that's where we need quantum cosmology. We need to marry quantum theory with general relativity. And we have a very poor understanding of how they meld together. But if we get more and more evidence from these earlier times where we know we need that combination to describe, things, well, if we have data from that period, that would just be great. So the earlier, the better is a simple answer to your question in terms of evidence. When we talk about the accelerating universe, which comes to us via the Hubble expansion measurements of Type Ia supernovae,

### 20m

there's also a way of triangulating or cross-checking the CMB measurements or maps against that. Is that correct? Is there a way of checking to see that you've got an accelerating universe given a more precise map of the anisotropies? You're right that they're interlocking. I mean, whenever, for example, you talk about the supernova, the supernova research found an accelerating universe. But when you combine that with the microwave background, you can say that the universe is made out of about 30% matter and about 70% of this lambda, this cosmological constant, which is the source of, we think, the source of the acceleration. So all of the cosmological data has to fit together. And when you put it all together, you get the standard model now. It's called the lambda CDM. Lambda means there's dark energy at about 70%. CDM means that there's cold, dark matter at about 25%.

### 21m

And then you have matter like you and me in the periodic table at about 5%. So that is the standard model. There are many, many different ways. And one of them is to check that, the CMB, and in particular, what's called the power spectrum of the CMB. That's how much power there is in these fluctuations. So hot spots, cool spots on this scale, hot spots, cool spots on this scale, hot spots, cool spots on that scale. So the whole range of scales, and you put that power together, it creates a power spectrum. That power spectrum can tell us all kinds of things, particularly how old the universe is, this 13.8 value that comes up. How many? How much dark matter there is. How much lambda there is. And that has to correlate with, that has to be consistent with other observations like the supernova ones you talked about, or the baryonic acoustic oscillations, or for just simply the age of the universe. If you find something that's 15 billion or 20 billion years old,

### 22m

that is inconsistent with what we know about the age of the universe based on general relativity and all of these observations I just mentioned. And if you find something that's 20 billion years old, you're going to win a Nobel Prize, but you're going to have to communicate. You're going to have to convince an awful lot of people why your results are better than the ones that we have so far. Do you have a favoured explanation, well it wouldn't be an explanation at the moment, conjecture about what cold dark matter is or what the solution might be? Could it be a... I said to disfavour the MOND, the Modified Newtonian Dramatics, because they invoke it for particular observations and not all of the ones that you could invoke it for. So I kind of disfavour that. I don't like that one. Axion seems like an interesting character, interesting candidate. The WIMPs, weakly interacting massive particles. I even like the machos. These are massive compact halo objects and they could be composed of primordial black holes, for example. So my favourite, I guess, would be primordial black holes.

### 23m

Basically anything that does not shine, it could be a black dark matter candidate. Also I want to correct the idea that it's dark matter. It's not dark matter. Dark matter is... dust is dark matter and it absorbs light. This stuff does not absorb light, so it's more accurately called transparent matter. Yes, yes. I think this is where people can see that you earned your fame. And in Australia for quite a while there, you were the go-to guy for media outlets, wanting to know what was happening in the sky, you know, some asteroids passing over. Is it going to hit us? Let's go to Charlie Lineweaver. But it shows the flexibility of your mind, I think, in one person to be able to go from soccer to learning linguistics. And then history and physics, and then you go to cosmology. And now, let's turn to some even more fun stuff. You just seem to enjoy having fun with your career. The Planet of the Apes Hypothesis. And I want this to get into people's minds. This is such a wonderful little heuristic that Charlie has come up with, I think uniquely, in order to illustrate that the common misconception, what everyone seems to know,

### 24m

is that there are just trillions upon trillions upon trillions of planets out there. So of course there is going to be intelligent life out there. But Charlie pushes back on this so powerfully and so well with The Planet of the Apes Hypothesis. Could you recapitulate that for me here and now? So, you are familiar, presumably most of your listeners are familiar with The Planet of the Apes movie. And basically Charlton Heston has a crew that's been cryogenically preserved for a while and they crash land on some planet, they don't know where they are. And then, over the course of the movie, they find out that they have landed on Earth. And the weird thing about it is that they have, on this planet, they have watches, so they know that this is a 24-hour day. They can measure the atmosphere, it's 20% oxygen and 80% nitrogen, like ours is. It has a moon and it has three species of other apes. And it has corn, it has horses.

### 25m

And the ridiculous idea is that only at the end, when the guy, when Charlton Heston, with his squeeze, riding a horse, sees a half-buried Statue of Liberty, does he say, God damn it, this is Earth! And so the idea that somebody could land on a planet and see corn and horses and three species of apes speaking English and human beings who are mute, that just seems, these guys, I call this one of the largest errors in quirk-ometry. And the idea, they should have known, I mean, if you can measure the exact composition of the, or the length of the day or the length of the, or the length of the month, or the composition of the air, or the genet... The genetic quirkiness of corn and horses and three species of apes, you should, any biologist would know, this has to be Earth. But no, no, Charlton Heston, only when he sees the half-buried Statue of Liberty, he says, oh, this is Earth, God damn it, what have we done?

### 26m

So the reason I call that a fallacy is because it's so easy for us to think that we inhabit what you might call the intelligence niche, and that whenever we, if we go through World War Three or four or five and marginalize ourselves or kill or go extinct, that other species, i.e. the things that are most closely related to us on Earth, that is, that chimps, the gorillas, and the orangutans. They would necessarily converge on what seems to be this intelligence niche. And I, that's the idea that I'm pushing back on because humans do not, chimps do not want to become humans, and you, any more than humans want to become chimps. I mean, every, Every organism on Earth has evolved mechanisms, its brain, its liver, its lungs, its skin, to stay alive in the niche, in the environment in which it's evolving. And to pretend that, oh, our evolution is so wonderful and great that any other species would want to evolve into it, that's the part that I call the Planet of the Apes fallacy.

### 27m

And another way to say that is that humans are unique, just like every other species. That's something I repeat again and again and again, because all I hear from people is, humans are unique, humans are unique. Why are humans so special? Why are humans so special? And people come up with all kinds of reasons. We're special because of this. It's just an exercise in vanity. But when you say humans are unique, I admit that. But just like every other species, it puts it in perspective in a way that I think is important. And when we go looking... You wouldn't go looking for a sulfur-crested cockatoo on another planet. You wouldn't go looking for an Indian elephant on another planet. You wouldn't go looking for a naked mole rat on another planet. And yet, people are looking for other people on other planets. How do I know that? Because they've defined intelligence to be human-like intelligence. An example of that is, we have this big brain, right? We have a big brain, but our olfactory lobes are tiny.

### 28m

I have a dog that can live... I have a dog that lives in a world of smells, and I have absolutely no recognition of the smells that she can smell. And so, to pretend that our way of seeing... We're primates, and so vision is very, very important. A dog, smelling is much more important. So, I'm trying to relativize what your brain is for, and not pretend that our brain is somehow more general and better, and therefore a convergent feature of evolution, no matter which planet you find life on. It's basically the four-minute version of the fallacy of the planet of the apes. That's brilliant, yeah. So, another way of putting this is that, among various species, we've found wings, which have evolved independently, whether it's insects, fish, birds, of course, mammals. But we're not getting these large brains that are able to generate explanations, cropping up over and again. Maybe our ancestor species, it seemed to have happened once, Australia left on its own for however many hundreds of millions or tens of millions of years.

### 29m

The kangaroos, as you like to say, weren't about to start developing radio astronomy, nor should we expect there to be a direction anywhere in evolution. However, I've also heard people say that life is inevitable, or increased complexity is inevitable. Is there any such inevitability given the laws of... Well, you asked a few questions there, so let me start out with this. The continents you mentioned. Now, we now have about six or seven continents, and we know because of plate tectonics that they have drifted around. And you can estimate, based on the plate tectonics and the rate at which plates are moving around, how long these continents were independent of each other. So, Australia, for example, has been independent of other continents about 100 million years. The same thing for South America has been independent until it ran into North America about 3 million years ago. So, the evolution of landlocked creatures, is not just one experiment on Earth, there are at least six experiments on Earth,

### 30m

but I would also argue that any time you have sexually reproducing critters, they are essentially evolving separate from each other, so you have a million separate experiments in evolution. And when you look at what happened on Australia, for example, now, if human-like intelligence was a convergent feature of evolution, you would expect, you know, there's two kangaroos, this kangaroo over here had three more neurons, and it gave it the ability to move. Well, it would be a little bit smarter when it came to X, Y, and Z, and then et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It survives a little bit better, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and so it evolves into a big brain creature. That type of argument is easy to make, but apparently, that's not the way evolution works, because it hasn't worked that way in every experiment that has been done. In other words, there have been at least six natural experiments for what does evolution do with landlocked vertebrates, and those experiments are called Madagascar. India, Australia, New Zealand, South America, and North America,

### 31m

and the point is that we find no evidence for evolution towards human-like intelligence, and that is the best evidence we have to evaluate whether our type of intelligence is a convergent feature or not, and the answer that's, I think, strongly suggestive, if not definitive, is that evolution does not try to produce human-like intelligence anywhere. If it did, well, for example, we have a brain this big, but we went from this big to this big in about three, four million years. It tripled in size. Now, okay, so if three or four million years is a characteristic timescale for this creating a big brain, well, I mentioned that Australia had been independent for about 100 million years, so that's 25 times longer than it took our particular species to get this big brain, so obviously, it could have happened in Australia, or in New Zealand, or in South America, and when you look at the critters that are most similar to, you know, big-brained humans,

### 32m

you find out that, hey, they are not big brains. They are some of the primates in South America. They're, I don't know, kangaroos or wombats. I don't know what you want to call the most human-like critter that evolved in Australia, but it's certainly not many people would think it's likely to become an electrical engineer and start sending out signals. And start sending out signals to the rest of the universe. Or you could ask the question, it's a very hypothetical question, how long would it take for anything in Australia, a kangaroo, a wombat, or an echidna, a monotreme, to evolve into an electrical engineer and start doing what we know how to do, humans? And the answer is, who knows? Probably never. And if that's the answer, then human-like intelligence is not a convergent feature of evolution. It's evidence that humans are unique, just like every other species, and these other unique species are not trying to evolve into what we are any more than we are trying to evolve into a worm or a dog

### 33m

or a, I don't know, the tree outside my window here. So it's not trying to become a human. We're not trying to become it. And so that's kind of a relativistic way of looking at these things, but I think that is what the lesson of the independent continents and the evolution on these continents during 50, 60, 100 million years is telling us. They should take that seriously, take less seriously our vanity and wanting to believe that we are unique but we are so great that other life forms elsewhere in the universe will evolve into electrical engineers and start producing radio telescopes. Yes, so this answers the Fermi Paradox. At least it is one possible solution to the Fermi Paradox. But it's not to say that in those, on those, trillions upon trillions of other planets that are out there, they couldn't be covered all in, in sludge and slime and bacteria and archaea and those kind of things, given that, and your own research has touched upon this,

### 34m

how relatively quickly life seemed to have arose in the geological record here on planet Earth. Did it arise very, very quickly, unusually quickly? I don't know about unusually quickly. As a word, I'm completely foreign to my vocabulary. Well, what we can talk about, we have estimates for how quickly it evolved. The Earth and the Sun and the solar system, it's about 4.5 billion years old, 4.567 if you're interested in more digits. And the Earth started out hot, and then it had to cool down. And the life, what we call life now, has a thermal limit. It's somewhere between 121, which is the current maximum, to maybe as high as 220. And you might ask the question, wait a minute, doesn't water boil at 100? Yes, it does. But we're talking about water under pressure, and so water can get up to 200. Or a few, well, maybe, I'm not sure, maybe even 320 Celsius. No, is that Celsius?

### 35m

Yes, that's Celsius. And so where was I on this? Oh, you're asking, did life start early? Well, I wouldn't say early. I wouldn't say late. I would say it started at a certain time, and there was a slow evolution. And it looks like now, based on research that just came out last month, that it's somewhere between, let's say, 4.3, and 3.9. So let's say, to round it off, I just often say, life has been on the planet Earth for about four billion years. The issue about why that's important for the probability of life is, imagine that, let's say, imagine that you want to roll, rolling a dice? Well, let's talk about the German tank problem. I don't know if I've told you about this. And that is, imagine you're in World War II, and you have just captured a tank, and the number on the tank is five. And your captain says, well, can you tell us how many they have?

### 36m

We need to know how big the tank army is of the Germans. And just based on, if you have captured a random number, and it is five, it's very, very unlikely that they have a billion, or a million, or even 200 tanks. It's much more likely that you have captured a random number, and that would be, maybe they have 10. Maybe they have six. Maybe they have 50. Something like that. In other words, you can infer the number even from just one example. So, applying the same analysis that life on Earth started very quickly, that means that the probability of it starting under those conditions was higher. The earlier something happens, the more probable it was, is the general idea. If you make the assumption that the same or similar conditions were available on other Earth-like planets and water, elsewhere, then you can infer about the probability of life elsewhere. That basic bottom line is, under those assumptions, the earlier we find that life has evolved on Earth,

### 37m

the more likely life is to have evolved elsewhere. Yes. So, although people often point to the idea that, well, we've just got an n of one when it comes to Earth and observing life, what you've pointed out there, quite right, is no, we have more than just n equals one. We also have time constraints as well. And those time constraints make a lot of difference about inferring whether or not... Right, so we do have an n of one, but we also, as you point out, we have information on the timing of that n of one. So, it might very well still be the case for the optimists that, if they're optimists about wanting there to be aliens out there, there could be alien bacteria out there. What are the chances of alien multicellular organisms, alien vertebrates or something like that? That's much more hard to say. Or you could also ask, what's the probability of alien viruses? So, we just talked about the origin of life and that you can get a rough handle on it, the estimate of how probable it is based on how quickly it evolved on Earth.

### 38m

As to what happens after that, I just wave my hands. This is a very important point because you mentioned earlier that, I think you said flight, and Richard Dawkins and many others, including Simon Conway Morris, have made the point that, oh, there are many examples in the history of evolution on Earth in which there has been convergence on certain traits. And I've been pushing back on this for about 20 years. And the reason I push back is because of what I call deep homology. So, what I mean by that is, so, you will see Richard Dawkins, probably in 10 of his books, he says, their vision has evolved multiple times, or the eye or eyes have evolved multiple times. And I've heard that repeated hundreds of times and I think it's just wrong. And the reason, excuse me, the reason I think it's wrong is the following. He talks about vertebrate and invertebrate eyes. Okay? And he says, oh, look at that, that's an independent origin. But, like all life on Earth,

### 39m

they have common ancestors. You and I have a common ancestor maybe 10 generations, maybe 20 generations ago. We and chimpanzees have a common ancestor about six or seven million years ago. Now, you can ask the question, when was the common ancestor of vertebrates with this vertebrate eye and invertebrates with this supposedly independent eye? And the answer is something like 600 million, maybe 500 million years. And then you have to ask the question, did that common ancestor have anything that looked like an eye? And the answer is yes. It had what you could call proto-eyes or proto-proto-eyes. So, when you say it evolved independently, you're pretending that you don't have a common ancestor which had the prerequisites and a lot of the basic ingredients, including the basic biochemicals, the biochemistry that octopus eyes and our eyes currently have. So, that's what I'm invoking what's called deep homology, deep common ancestry that you need to know about

### 40m

what was already there before you talk about convergence. Another short way to say it is everybody has a common ancestor and if you want to talk about convergence, you have to talk about divergence. If you want to talk about divergence, you have to know how similar, what fraction of the trait you're converging on was already down here. That aspect is the crucial part of this argument and it is systematically ignored by all people who are talking about convergence on flight, convergence on eyes, convergence on what other things they talk about. Well, anyway, there are many things. Two of the most important ones are the flight and eyeballs. So, avatar was basically set on Earth, obviously, because there's just so much there that is convergent. Okay, we're going to go from four-legged creatures. This is an interesting debate about whether dragons have four legs and wings or just have hind legs and wings, kind of like... And also bats. We talk about flight, for example. Let's talk about flight.

### 41m

Birds and bats, bats are mammals, birds are reptiles, evolved from reptiles. They have a common ancestor about 30, 320, 340 million years ago. The question is, did the common ancestor have flight? Well, not really, but it did have four legs. Birds go like this with their front legs, and bats do the same thing with their front legs. So, obviously, the ability to go like this was in the common ancestor of bats and birds. So, that's another example of one of the more fundamental aspects of the trait you're talking about was already in the common ancestor, and that's why I keep on invoking you have to talk about it. You have to talk about what was in the common ancestor before you talk about convergence. So, deep homology is usually ignored, and convergence is always, oh, it looks wonderful. It's converging on the same thing. Another example. Oh, here's another example. Dolphins and humans. We have big brains. Dolphins have big brains.

### 42m

But we know that our common ancestor with dolphins was more like a cow-like thing, and this would have been 95 million years ago. We know these timings from the genetic proximities to each other. And so, here we start out a creature. Now, let's say here's 4 billion years ago, and here's today. We have a common ancestor with dolphins 95 million years ago. That's less than the thickness of my finger up here. So, we were identical, identical, identical, identical, identical, revolving all kinds of the same gene hierarchies, the same organs, the same eyes, the same bilateral symmetry. And then, 95 million years ago, we diverged. Now, although the common ancestor had a small brain, we know that the things that regulate how big your ears are, how big any your chin is, or big your heart is, or small, those are things that are, have turned into toggle switches that you have the same gene regulatory networks that the dolphins have. So, you flip a switch very easily, and then, oh, your nose gets bigger, or your brain gets bigger. And so, that's not convergence on something, it's a result of an identical system

### 43m

of wiring that evolved during 3, no, 4 billion years, minus 95 million. So, that's that thickness of, so, it's a little like, another example would be, you know, identical twins. Let's say you, two twins are born, and let's say they grow up as carpenters, and they get taught the same things, and then, suppose then at the age of, I don't know, 15, they're separated for 3 years. And then you find out, oh my gosh, they've been separated, they've converged on the same type of cabinet. And so, of course they have, because they had for 4 billion years, or for, you know, the first part of their lifetimes, they were identical twins with the same genes and the same environment, and that sets you up to be able to produce many of the same things that, although they might not be there when they were separated, they converged on it only because of these prerequisites and deep homology. That would be my argument against the invocation of convergence that seems to be in style

### 44m

among most biologists today. Well, I think you're disappointing a lot of people who really want to believe, you know, the whole X-files thing, that the UAPs really are from the other side of the galaxy. There's not going to be convergence on intelligence. Never mind that. There's not even going to be any convergence on... Well, wait a minute, Brent. You must know me well enough now that I don't care whether I disappoint people or not. I'm not in the business of disappointing them or appointing them. I'm just trying to follow the evidence. Well, let's throw them a bone. I will not throw anybody a bone. The shadow... I will... Whatever bone you're talking about, I refuse to throw. But go ahead, John. The shadow bias for you. This is a paper you wrote, I think with Paul Davies as well, another one co-authored with Davies, about the aliens might already be here, but we might just not recognize them. So tell us a little bit about the shadow bias for you. You know, DNA was discovered by 1953, 1954. And over the past 70 years, we've found out more and more. We've learned how to sequence genomes.

### 45m

Actually, after 2001, when we had the human genome, was the first full genome to be sequenced. And since then, the number of species for which we have the whole genome has just skyrocketed, exponential, even more than super exponential. So that's because the technology has been cheaper, gotten cheaper, and we know more and more about other critters. So what was the question again? Oh, the shadow bias here. So as we have... Now, when you have dozens and dozens and hundreds and now thousands, even tens of thousands of species whose whole genomes have been sequenced, you can compare them. Just like we talked, we can compare humans and chimps and find out, whoa, this is the creature that's in the whole world is closest to us. And then we thought, oh, what's the second most? Then you find out it's a gorilla. Then what's the third most? Then it's orangutan. What's the fourth most? It's gibbons. And you create this whole tree, not just of humans, our lineage, but of every lineage. You have a tree out there. I don't know. It's a...

### 46m

Let's say it's a plum tree. And then you say, oh, that's a hard fruit. And then you figure out what's the closest one to the plum tree. And you do the same thing back and back and back. And so you're creating, for the first time, we have what's called the tree of life based on just zillions and zillions of... Well, not zillions. I won't... Let's just say tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of species whose genomes have been compared and then you're creating this whole branch tree of life. And the question was, oh, the shadow... Now, when you're creating this tree, every once in a while, you will find something that is a common... that is deeper than the tree of life. And the question was, oh, the shadow... Now, when you're creating this tree, every once in a while, you will find something that is a common... that is deeper than another branch. For example, let's suppose you only knew about humans, chimps, and gorillas, and then you say, oh, I found something deeper. It's an orangutan. So then you go deeper. The common ancestors are even deeper. Oh, I found a dog. That goes even deeper. Oh, I found a jawless fish. That goes even deeper. So the history of this... the progress that we're making in genetics is finding deeper and deeper branches in the tree of life.

### 47m

Now, for example, in 1976, a guy named Carl Woese found archaea. Essentially, that was an even deeper branch. You used to think there's, you know, bacteria, and then somehow one branch of bacteria became eukaryotes, but now we know that eukaryotes, you, me, plants, fungi, grew out most of it from a type of archaea. And so there was an even deeper branch when he found that out. But what we said, well, with the history of defining deeper branches, let's just hypothesize that we're going to find some more deep branches. And then you say, well, wait a minute. What kind of things would they be? How would we recognize them? And you recognize them in the same way that Carl Woese recognized archaea, and that is you do very careful analysis of their DNA to find out, whoa, this is completely different than anything we had before, and that, therefore, it has an ancestor that has a common ancestor with us and with all life on Earth that is even deeper. That common ancestor, the most recent, it's called Leuca, the last universal common ancestor

### 48m

of all life. And so the hypothesis that we made was that that Leuca keeps on receding into the past as we find out more and more about life that is weirder and different from the existing life that we know about. And so we predicted that on Earth there are these other life forms we call the shadow biosphere or something you call dark life. In other words, life forms that we don't know about yet but would have a deeper branching and therefore they would be a new type of life. I should say it's not just one type of life. You get deeper, you get a different type of life for each one that you attach to a deeper branch of the tree of life. And you can get that Leuca, the last universal common ancestor, deeper and deeper and deeper and each one of those separate branches would be what you might call alien life or dark life or life we do not yet know about in the same way that we did not yet know about the Archaea until 1976. And Archaea are an interesting example. I think many strands of Archaea they're thermophilic,

### 49m

am I correct? So they're heat-loving life forms and so even places that were thought previously to be completely inhospitable in fact could be replete with Archaea and so therefore you could have perhaps under the surface of even Venus or something like that you might be able to have. I wouldn't go that far but the basic point you're making is right. But also not just Archaea but there are some species of bacteria which are thermophilic and even hyperthermophilic. These are the ones that can live at temperatures above 90 Celsius. I assume that you took a shower this morning or last night and if you did the temperature of that shower I can guarantee was less than 60 degrees because we are not hyperthermophilic or thermophilic we are mesophilic and that means that as a matter of fact all eukaryotes have this limit of about 60 degrees and what happens is that when you go to temperatures higher than that your protein denatures like boiling an egg and so that's why you get burns. But bacteria some bacteria

### 50m

can love that 60 degree water 70, 80, hey I like my favorite and also archaea like this and so we call them extremophiles but there is some evidence that the first life on earth was hyperthermophilic and so for them we are the ones who are extremophiles because we love these ridiculously cold temperatures of less than 60 centigrade. Yeah and so that along with what you did about the statistics of life arising early on in the earth that could perhaps be from this one n equals one place of earth to other planets and perhaps it arises there early perhaps in places which are otherwise considered inhospitable life could arise there but and I was talking to you about this recently and I'm still unclear Miller-Urey type experiments when they're done over and again in the laboratory what they seem to be able to produce are amino acids now you were impressed

### 51m

by the existence of amino acids I was less impressed because I thought that they were in interstellar space anyway but is there a contradiction here between on the one hand it seems like life arose early on the earth therefore it's easy to produce but on the other professional scientists working in labs trying to create artificial life are unable to do so is life easy to make or isn't it? Well you know what there's another paper that I wrote called we have not detected extraterrestrial life or have we? The answer was that we do not know what life is now to back this up I did a survey of biologists and I asked them are viruses alive and just to remind you viruses are the most common organisms on earth and my first survey result was half of them said yes half of them said no and I concluded from that that we don't know what life is but then I said Charlie

### 52m

do a better job of this analysis please and a quarter of them said yes a quarter of them said no a quarter of them said the question doesn't make sense and a quarter of them said it doesn't matter so that's that's how much biologists know about life now and I concluded from that that we don't know what life is but I recently changed my mind completely on this I said that doesn't tell us that we don't know what life is that tells us that we do know what life is why is that? I said that this is what life is and that's what I'm trying to say is that as we go deeper into the tree we start to see that life gets deconstructed as you go earlier and earlier and maybe viruses are at the base of the tree of life that this thing called life should disappear is exactly what you expect if you have a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life if that's the case you have to start out

### 53m

with non-life you have to evolve into something lifelike and therefore we don't know whether they're life or not and that's exactly what the model of a naturalistic origin predicts and so I've completely reversed my opinion on that saying these results tell us that we do know what life is and that it has changed and it's consistent with the idea of evolving from non-life basically what I want to say is that clear that point? I think it's a profound point but the answer to the simple question what is life? Okay my answer to that question is what is your answer to what is a human being? Well I can give an answer to that No you can't I think I will deconstruct any answer you think you have but here's my thoughts on this you can ask the question are Neanderthals human beings? and you and I have about 2% Neanderthal genes so by the criteria that if you can have

### 54m

the same species then we and Neanderthals are the same species that means we are Homo sapiens sapiens and Neanderthals are Homo sapiens Neanderthalenses in other words we are not two different species we are two different subspecies that can interbreed and interestingly the only museum I've ever found that acknowledged this what I consider a blatant fact was in the University of no it's in in Zurich the University the not the University the Natural History Museum of Zurich in which they had the words Homo sapiens Neanderthalenses and Homo sapiens sapiens and they were distinguishing between these subspecies now so then we ask what about what about Homo erectus notice that we have it's not Homo sapiens erectus however there is some components in our genes and in Neanderthal genes that looks like it might be erectus genes in other words and also I should also mention the Denisovans so Denisovans

### 55m

Neanderthals and Homo sapiens they're all mixed up in the genes and so they're the same species and so they're different subspecies but then the question comes what about Homo erectus is that the same species well we've said Homo erectus not Homo sapiens so therefore we're assuming that it's a different species but I suspect that in our genomes and then that you will find some Homo erectus genes which would mean it would be Homo sapiens erectus the bottom line is that any current species and has evolved from something that wasn't itself and in other words there is no time in which there was a mother that gave birth to a child that child was a Homo sapiens and the mother wasn't that's just a silly idea evolution is gradual like that that graduality is what prevents you from saying I know what a human being is because there is no boundary there in which the mother is not a Homo sapiens and the child is so push back on that yes so in the Star Trek universe we have

### 56m

you know all the alien species out there the Klingons and whoever and you have the humans and you have Commander Data and they are the three kinds of people I would say they are on a par Commander Data he pretends not to have emotions but he would in the real life case he would be regarded as artificial general intelligence he would have a mind that is effectively able to do anything that a human mind could do and as to for the Klingons and for other alien type species that are able to generate explanations of the rest of physical reality let me stop you there let me stop that Parparian explanation I am older than you and so I am with Captain Kirk the first generation of Star Trek and so now you know Spock right Spock had a mother who was human and a father who was a Vulcan Superman had a mother well actually no he had two parents that were from Krypton he came to Earth

### 57m

he was able to have sex with Lois Lane at least in some comic books and then they had a child so here is a species this is this is an example of how easily we pretend we project homo sapiens onto the universe pretending that Vulcans some species that evolved on another planet could have sex and be fertile with a what an Earthling and that is just a ridiculous idea you can't even have something that evolved on a continent and independently of another one and then saying oh they are going to have sex it just it doesn't work that way so that is the degree to which in our brains we pretend that human like intelligence and human like genes are convergent and we should expect homo sapiens elsewhere Carl Sagan was guilty of this he talked about the functional equivalent of homo sapiens but I don't think he went so far as to support the idea that Vulcans could intermarry with human beings your point however no I agree with you your point is more about the explanatory power so what you are doing when you say not mating

### 58m

and nothing to do with genetics but rather to do with the actual mind it has everything to do with genetics this is where I disagree with you you talk about explanatory power as if if you pretend that humans on Earth are the things that have this ability to do explanatory power and I wouldn't necessarily disagree with you on that that means you are talking about a species specific characteristic pretending that that species specific characteristic belongs to a more general group called any creature in the universe that has explanatory power and I would say that's just pretending that there's a naked mole rat we should go looking for naked mole rats you should go looking for Indian elephants no you cannot generalize something that you admit is unique to Earth and then pretend that it's a member of a general set elsewhere so in other words our I believe in the entire universe are here on planet Earth and they're called chimpanzees yes

### 59m

and if we genetically no no I mean I not only genetically phenotypically behaviorally every any way you think of and you want to say no explanatory power is such a convergent feature that any creature that evolved under selection pressure elsewhere will evolve explanatory power and I said there's no evidence for that and there's evidence against it because kangaroos whether they can that's another example that we talked about earlier of explanatory power evolving independently on Australia and the answer is no and when you say explanatory power I think you need to admit that this is a uniquely human thing at least you can define it that way and if that's the case you do not it makes zero sense to go looking for uniquely human things elsewhere in the universe at least that's what I would argue yet no I absolutely agree as I say I buy and I'm a great supporter of the planet of the apes hypothesis I don't think that there are intelligent species out there

### 1h 0m

the point was that if if there was you know whatever chance there happens to be another alien species out there they would count as people of course they would not count as nor be able to interbreed with homo sapiens sapiens that doesn't make any sense but they would be a person by virtue of the fact that they can have an understanding of the rest of physical reality and so they would be able to presumably in the distant future build a spacecraft that could travel across the universes perhaps one day we will be able to and so if we encounter these other people we will share our ideas and this is the kind of thing that we will be able to uniquely do unlike you know elephants coming across giraffes or something they're not really going to share ideas but we will share ideas so what you're doing is saying that this is something that I think you would identify on earth only with homo sapiens and then you're proposing and imagining that it would evolve

### 1h 1m

elsewhere in other words no I don't think as I say I don't think that it will for the planet of the hapes hypothesis reason I don't think that it will happen if it did however if if if big if then yes I see well I okay well then I think we agree mostly but maybe we have a difference I think so yeah it's the only difference in emphasis and it just comes out because one thing animating people right now is are we going to get to artificial general intelligence people think that they know chat GPT it's just so impressive that any moment now it's going to become alive it's going to become able to create knowledge and take over your job or my job or anyone else's job and I don't buy this idea I don't think you're going to be able to extrapolate from more and more processing power inside of the hardware to what the hardware is programming to do you know you have to program the thing to do something and we are not programmed to do something we are programmed to if anything

### 1h 2m

write our own programs to be creative I would push that much much harder against this idea of artificial general intelligence in a way that was reminiscent of the argument I made earlier and that is brains this brain that you have that I have these are the result of our lots of our ancestors dying and the ones with this type of brain so so what we call we pretend that our type of I think our type of intelligence I call it human like intelligence I should just call it human intelligence just like a dog has dog intelligence and a cat has cat intelligence and a tree has tree intelligence and it's this word intelligence is very hard to define some people say wait a minute there's emotional intelligence and mathematical intelligence and then there's you know the ability to dance intelligence then there's you know an n-dimensional thing and call it intelligence but whatever humans have I would call it unique to humans but it has common we have common ancestors other things

### 1h 3m

for example dogs and us have a common ancestors 95 million years ago and you can see that dogs have olfactory lobes and their brains have about the same they're bilaterally symmetric and all kinds of similarities but what was wait I've lost the point here remind me of this question we're talking about the universality of our capacity to create explanations of the universe yeah I wouldn't say the universe I think well let's talk about substrate independent intelligence now a lot of people believe in that I have I do not believe in it for one second and the reason is is I'm not a Cartesian Cartes Descartes says oh there's brain and then there's body and I said no your brain is part of your body you cannot reify it you cannot pretend that it is not integrally integrated into your body and it would be crazy to take a brain out and say okay we're gonna put it in the computer that makes no sense to me at all and yet I'm a materialistic reductionist and say hey it's all there's nothing special

### 1h 4m

about the type of meat we have in the processing except for the fact that it has four billion years of evolving inside of something whose environment has been like this this this this this it has hormones all kinds of exchanges with your body that's going on right now and to pretend that you can pull that out of its environment and say oh this is this is somehow is the big mistake that I think people are making it's kind of like there's zero environmental consciousness as a matter of fact some people would think that well talk about let's talk about asteroids coming and impacting earth if asteroid lands and coming out of the blind spot and kills all kinds of things one of the things that's going to survive are bacteria and archaea and simple things so if you create all kinds of scenarios in which life goes extinct you know global warming what comes out on top are the things that were came out earlier that have been around for four billion years that have survived such things for four billion years

### 1h 5m

and that is not us but it is things like the bacteria and archaea so from if you're going to talk about you have a brain to survive and if you don't survive then your brain has not done a good job and so your type of intelligence is not very good but the type of intelligence that the bacteria have is better for this situation so I don't what was the question again artificial intelligence you think it's not possible I don't even believe in that word I think that the word general is kind of like saying our intelligence is the best kind it's the most general and therefore that's the one that we have to be concerned with and I just think that's ridiculous you cannot take a human brain and put it into a computer and you will not be the same person it will be a different thing and it will be totally completely I don't want to use the word autistic but it will be isolated in a way that is so unnatural that it's going to die because everything in there is meant to be inside and integrated into eyeballs

### 1h 6m

and ears and hormones and heartbeat and etc so it's kind of like it just makes no sense to me at all this word artificial and general intelligence I think if you want to talk about human intelligence and you can make something that plays go you can make something that drives a car that's the future of self-driving cars they will get better and better and better at driving a car but you wouldn't call that general intelligence you'd call that car-driving intelligence you could have a robot that was really good at dancing and the better it gets at dancing hey that's not general intelligence that's dancing intelligence so the intelligence that evolves depends on the environment that you put something into what we call general is simply because we don't we pretend that we are not ants or no we are not ants we are not dogs we are not bacteria our intelligence we pretend is general and it's just not that way it's a very specific humans are unique just like every other species and so we should not use this word general artificial general intelligence geron lenier he's a computer scientist he's one of the fathers of virtual

piecemeal you could do it an atom at a time if you like with advanced technology we could have a person that didn't technically evolve but rather they were built at a moment right so first of all your your example is exactly what you're doing right now and that is your neurons are being replaced you know one goes bad and then it gets replaced and sometimes it doesn't get replaced and that's not so great but but replacement is something that your body knows how to do in general so you are in in a very real sense a ship of theseus in which almost all parts of all cells in your body have been replaced now interestingly you can study which cells in your body get replaced more often and the linings of your intestine for example and liver cells and skin cells these are places that have a natural ability to get replaced because naturally they for example the lining of your gastrointestinal tract is digesting meat now you are made out of meat so essentially that lining is getting digested and so you have to

### 1h 9m

replace it and that that replacement is mitosis that goes on and one of the reasons that uh organs that are highly mitotic in the normal way is that they're not going to be able to be replaced in the normal way are closer to cancers because they have replacements that uh they have ability to turn on mitosis that's much closer to the surface than the more mature differentiated cells that don't mitose as much during its natural lifetime so matter of fact there's something called bomb biology 1960-61-62 there were bombs going off and they produced very rare isotopes they got incorporated into the cells that were being produced in a body at that time and so by looking at the cells that were being produced in a body at that time and so by looking at the cells that were being produced in a body at that time and so by looking at the looking at by searching for these rare isotopes in people of different ages and their different organs you can tell which organs have been completely rejuvenated since those last bombs and which of them have a remnant of those isotopes and so it's called bomb biology and it helps you

### 1h 10m

know how quickly would different organs get their cells replaced you got dangerously close there to mentioning the atavistic theory of cancer the thing the one thing i won't talk to you about here because a wonderful podcast was produced and i'll link to that that you did recently discussing the atavistic model of cancer absolutely brilliant so i'll finish because you've been very generous with your time with just a question that's completely left field about the potato radius which is just such a fun paper that i used to direct my own students to as to why objects that exist out there in nature have the shapes they do could you explain a little what is the potato radius and what does it solve because you're bringing together empirical science observing stuff with calculating stuff as well you're marrying up uh these two sides of theoretical science and an experimental so about 20 years ago you may have heard of the pluto crisis in which people were trying to figure out whether pluto is a planet or not the reason was mike brown at caltech had discovered something that was eris uh something that's now called eris that seemed to be

### 1h 11m

possibly was larger than pluto and so you know we have these planets mercury you know venus earth etc mars and you know we have these planets mercury you know venus earth etc mars and you see there's multiple different kinds of things already and that's what's seen this is probably slow but a typical example and it's a huge help for more people with the happy though you get lots and lots of bodies asteroid for example the asteroids if you look at the asteroid the asteroid starts from what i call theeros of the rainbow that's related to world fat began then asteroid's if you look at the asteroid belt between mars and and jupiter you will see some of the small things look like kind of weird shapes and then the bigger ones are always spherical freaking simple it's not like that spherical like the sun for example is spherical the earth and mercury all these things are spherical but then as you look at the asteroids the biggest ones like ceres for example is Friends really is spherical and then you get smaller and smaller and they start to look not like a then you get smaller and smaller and they start to look like a noumbra the bright light is basically not like a sphere, but more like a potato, and then when they get even smaller, they look like weirder shapes, you know, it looks like, I don't know, like this, or like this, and the point is that large objects, the shape, when you have a spherical shape, that means that gravity, self-gravity, has been able to overcome the molecular forces that hold things together. For example, this pen, if I

### 1h 12m

made this pen a million times bigger, it would start to become rounder and rounder. Why? Because the gravity on this thing would be pulled towards the center, and the same thing over here, it would get rounder and rounder. So, if I made me bigger and bigger, I'd start to look like one of those Thanksgiving Day balloons, puffier and rounder, and then if I got even bigger, it would be rounder and rounder. So, in other words, self-gravity makes things into spheres, because that's the minimum energy configuration. But, when you get smaller and smaller, you don't have as much self-gravity. Gravity starts to lose compared to molecular forces. Molecular forces are things that just hold together. So, if I made this pen a million times bigger, it would start to look like the neighboring things together, and there's no constraint on it to be spherical. And so, you can see this transition between sphere to potato at a certain radius. And the reason why this was important was because in the definition of a planet, you have this thing saying you have to be a sphere, or there's a fancy term for a type of, if you rotate a sphere, it gets flatter and

### 1h 13m

like an M&M or a Smartie. So, that's consistent with being spherical. But, you just have a spin to it. And so, the question is, when does a body lose its self-gravity? When does self-gravity become so weak that the molecular forces start to win over, and you get pieces of rock that look like, well, the potatoes, they're kind of roundish, but then they get smaller, and they become more like arbitrarily shaped rocks. And then, at the even lower end, you get something like dust. You get all kinds of crazy shapes. And that's where gravity almost plays zero role. So, because the radius at which something became a planet was used to define a planet, we thought, what does this mean? When is this that you get to become a sphere? And so, we wrote a paper called The Potato Radius, which is the radius at which a potato turns into a sphere. And we looked at the data from all the, it's not much data to look at. You just look at the asteroids and see how big are

### 1h 14m

things that are spherical, and how small are things that are potatoes, and how even smaller do they get, even weirder shapes. And so, we identified this radius and did some physics about how much stress, you know, different objects have different stress abilities. So, for example, you imagine if there's a bowl of water, that it is spherical, or snow, it's not able to maintain mountains or different size shapes, it kind of just falls in on itself, because self-gravity is more important than the weaker molecular forces. But if you have stronger molecular forces, like in a rock or a steel or something, then the self-gravity has a harder time making it spherical. So, the analysis of that problem, when is this transition, we called it the Potato Radius, and it's important if you're interested in this distinction between objects that are large enough to be spherical and planetary, and ones that are not. That's excellent, fantastic. And it brings together your deep knowledge on chemistry, physics, geology, you've spoken about biology. Just a final question, what are you working on now?

### 1h 15m

What is the thing that's animating you right now? I've got a whole list of things here I thought they were going to ask us. One is, let's see. Well, I just put out a paper, I don't know, a couple of months ago, on all objects and some questions, and this is with a PhD student, no, a master's student I had, and we were working together on trying to figure out, if here's our universe, and we have an accelerating universe, we're going to end up as an island universe. And what that means is that our closest relative, Andromeda, and our galaxy are going to come together and form a local group universe, and beyond that, eventually, after many billions of years, all of the other galaxies that we can now see in our observable universe will disappear in the sense that they'll get redshifted beyond our ability to see them. So we will then be in a universe that will have a center. Now,

### 1h 16m

you may have, you know cosmology, cosmologists would never tire of saying the universe does not have a center. The universe, we are not the center of the universe. We're the center of our observable universe, in the same sense that a boat on the Pacific Ocean is the center of its horizon. The horizon is at a certain distance from it, but that's arbitrary. But in the far, far future, we, there, the center will be a giant black hole of about, let's see, how many, 10 to the 10 solar masses to a million, maybe, maybe 100 million solar masses. And that will be the center of the universe, our universe. And so our universe will go from, evolve from one that does not have a center to one that does. And so we're trying to figure out, based on what we know about the large scale structure of the universe and, and structures that will collapse into their own island universe, how many fragments will our current universe evolve into? So that's one thing. Another is, let's see, I mean, I'm interested in in freewill. My

### 1h 17m

wife is a lawyer. And she goes on because she loves штейн filmmakers and, and there are loads of также on and on about the injustices of law and they seem to be based on the belief in human free will so i've become interested in that problem because i've actually there's one theme that goes through most of my work and that is embedding connections things are connected to other things and you make a giant mistake when you pretend that things are isolated and when you say to somebody you know who committed the crime you say you could have done otherwise you say oh yeah you could have done where did that come from so the belief in human free will somehow is a belief in a superstitious idea that you can have an electron here that you can decide to move over there and so i guess the belief the non-belief in free will people like sam harris and and robert sopolski have written books about this but it's a giant debate that's been going on for 2 000 years but i think in law

### 1h 18m

it's particularly important because right now we're saying you could have done otherwise therefore you're guilty rather than looking carefully at the background of this person in front of you who used to be a baby who grew up in an environment that produced this crime and i would say it's the environment that produced the crime rather than the free will of the individual so i'm looking at free will as a so we're trying to write a book on that but that's that's another that's another kettle of worms yes well i'm waiting for a line we have a book that is that is that is something we need to see so um rather than me continue questioning you now because i could question you for another hour and 15 minutes i won't i will thank you politely for your time thank you so much this is where it has been a dream of mine you were the one of the greatest lecturers i had at the university of new south wales doing the life i think it's called what's called life elsewhere in the universe or life something like that are we alone maybe it was are we alone yeah fizz two one seven zero i think

absolutely fantastic course where we covered geology we covered physics we covered astronomy everything was brought together and it was just emblematic of the style of scientists that you are a polymath of the first order so thank you for your time thank you thank you for inviting me it's been fun you
