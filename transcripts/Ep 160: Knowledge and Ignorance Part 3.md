Welcome back to TopCast and to my discussion, my ongoing discussion, on Popper's lecture on the sources of knowledge and of ignorance. It appears in many places, but probably the most important place it does appear is in Conjectures and Refutations. I'm taking my time going through this because, hey, I'm enjoying it. It's good writing. It's clear stuff. It has examples of where this material is useful, both in a historical context and today. So I'll be interjecting with my own thoughts on what Popper has to say. I just happened to finish recording another TopCast episode about another thinker who comes to ideas about rationality, and there is just a poverty of coherence there at times. Not something you get in Popper. And so this is why it's so good for me to come back to something like that, because my other critiques, when it comes to reading other people's ideas and trying to understand where they're coming from,

### 1m

can leave me at times deflated, as if there is good stuff out there. Why aren't people concentrating on the good stuff? Yes, sometimes they can be completely ignorant of it. Perhaps they read it, as in certain cases I know they have, but then forget it, or read into it what they expect to be there with not realizing that there's something actually quite counter to what they think. About the nature of knowledge, for example. I suppose knowledge is a tricky beast to a certain extent. We inherit so much throughout our schooling, education, and culture about what this thing knowledge is. We had to wait really until Karl Popper to be given a coherent picture that more fully explored whole aspects of what was hitherto a kind of mysterious thing, this knowledge stuff. Now it is that we come to construct our ideas about reality, and whether or not we can say that

### 2m

these constructions accurately represent or model or explain some part of reality. I think we can, and I think Popper says that we can as well. And so our knowledge contains truth without being the truth. But this is sometimes hard to grapple with. The whole notion of conjectural knowledge can be a challenge for rather many people. It can be a challenge for the ancients in trying to understand what this stuff is and how it is we come to understand reality. And Popper has been speaking about in this particular lecture the classic philosophers, and in particular the philosophers in the empiricist tradition and the philosophers in the rationalist tradition. I ended my last episode on the notion that the truth is manifest doctrine comes in these two styles. The British empiricist view that of bacon, you just observe nature and derive knowledge or observe the facts of reality, let's say. And the

### 3m

continental European view, that of Descartes, that our reason cannot generally lead us astray. In either case, we can have the truth. And when we see it, we can understand it as the truth. Now there are virtues that do flow from this. This leads to some wonderful stuff, a liberation from authority. But whatever the case, the only explanation under that view of why it is that we make errors now and again, where our so-called fallibility comes from, because we aren't really fallible on this view, we just see the manifest truth. The only explanation is, we're being deceived by some greater powers. A conspiracy is afoot, keeping us in the dark through lies and deception. Other people, the authorities. This is why Popper was at pain to say that the liberal tradition would have it, following Milton among others that in a battle between truth and falsity truth will out truth will win that battle

### 4m

and therefore censorship is always wrong now popper was kind of saying not quite censorship is wrong but not because the truth will always win the battle he will come back to this but as we already know people are fallible so knowledge production is an imperfect journey of attempting to identify errors and correct them and the only way of doing this is to have it out in the public square so to speak so don't have censorship so the errors can be corrected not so the truth can be manifest in some way it might seem to be splitting hairs but it's not as popper emphasizes this truth is manifest doctrine is the root of all tyranny and he explained popper explained how plato and others because they thought was truth must manifest thought the government the kings and the rulers that they are quite right at times to just lie to the populace noble lies were there because the the the a regular citizen was incapable of ruling their blood the blood of the average citizen did not contain the right characteristics to enable them to understand what it took to preserve the greater good unlike the god-given gold in the blood of the ruling classes they could understand because they were born to rule hence lies by the ruling politicians can be okay now we all must admit we know the politicians who do this kind of thing it's

### 5m

it's almost a trope now the lying politician the government minister who insists well policy a will only cost x dollars and they keep the details from us knowing something about how much it will in fact cost or what the costings truly were without massaging the figures or rather the tax cuts are coming but after the next election then they don't or in this day and age saying this source of energy really is cheaper than that one in the long run when they either know the opposite is true or they don't themselves fully understand the details and that's a kind of dishonesty to you know you could have this prosaic honesty of saying i just do not understand the details but i'm taking it on the authority of the experts okay so that's bad but at least it would be honest and rather often one gets the sense what some politicians should be saying this and because that's really what they're thinking you can tell they don't understand some of the stuff they're talking about a parochial timely example that i probably shouldn't bring up

### 6m

in a podcast like this but recently in australia one of our own ministers in charge of energy policy was laughing literally laughing at the idea that anyone would suggest nuclear power as a solution or part of the solution to our current energy problems this is ignorance of the highest order but i digress ignorance is not quite lies it's the lies that i'm concerned about and was concerned about but all that said i may have been too quick to last episode because there is indeed a virtuous deployment of lies by government in the protection of the city and citizens we need only consider wartime it was right in world war two the allied governments would at times say that the day of the commencement of the battle of so and so would be a wednesday when they knew it would begin two days earlier this kind of misinformation given to their own citizens deceiving their own people is warranted or having a

### 7m

stated policy let's say of never negotiating with hostage takers or terrorists no matter the circumstances that might be their stated policy and what they say to the cameras and to their own citizens and yet behind the scenes they might very well be negotiating with the hostage takers and terrorists these lies protect the city and citizens and are on a continuum with all those lies that police and just regular people tell in order to defend themselves and each other lies in the service of self-defense they're quite right lies can be considered a kind of force the withholding of information or deliberate deployment of genuine misinformation that often misused term for a claim with which i do not agree misinformation is simply a lie and a lie is simply something i think is false but will act as if i think it's true anyways in order to deceive it's about deception but telling the nazis there is no one else in the house is not wrong though it's a lie i

### 8m

could go on you get the point these are cases where plato's lie by leaders in the service of protecting the citizens is quite right but those cases are exceptions that prove the existence of a general rule deception by politicians is wrong precisely because they are fallible and so is everyone else and only by telling the truth all the time or almost all the time can there possibly be a chance for error correction and progress not the guarantee of such correction and progress just the opportunity for it an opportunity that does not exist under regimes of heavy censorship by an elite who think they know better that they can always know better arises in the philosophy of plato because of a truth is manifest doctrine and a kind of racism this idea that you're born into the ruling class or born into the laboring class and thus the populist need at times on plato's view to be deceived it all sounds terrible but let us just

### 9m

recall Recall that the empiricism of Bacon and the rationalism of Descartes were forces that liberated civilization from a worse fate of being entirely under the thumb of other human authorities as the disseminators and validators of knowledge. Think for yourself and understand the truth yourself was the message of both the British and continental enlightenments. False though parts of the epistemology ultimately are. So what does Popper say next about all of that? We're up to now part six of On the Sources of Knowledge and of Ignorance and he goes on to say quote this false epistemology however has also led to disastrous consequences. The theory that

### 10m

truth is manifest that it is there for everyone to see if only he wants to see it this theory is the basis of almost every kind of fanaticism for only the most depraved wickedness can refuse to see the manifest truth only though who have every reason to fear truth can deny it and conspire to suppress it end quote. This is clearly a religious type impulse that a person is bad because they should see the manifest truth of the holy book let's say or of the teachings of the priest or prophet but even today modern incantations of certain philosophers certain philosophies have the same idea that certain people are bad people. They don't just have the wrong idea. They're bad people or perhaps they're mixed people as I sometimes hear partly good partly bad. This is a category error of as I've said before there are good ideas and bad ideas. The bad ideas

### 11m

tend to suppress the good ideas tend to suppress problem solving tend to suppress error correction and so on and so forth. We all have a mixture of ideas problems floating around inside of our minds but we are not identical to any of them. We have problem situations and we draw on certain ideas. Many of them may be false but they solve the problem for us but just because we have a whole bunch of bad ideas us qua person as a person are not bad. Our actions can be bad. Our thoughts can be bad but we are just that thing that has certain ideas and generates certain explanations but we are responsible for our ideas however and responsible for reflecting upon our ideas because we can fall into fanaticism as well. Just as Popper says there one way to avoid that is to recognize the truth is not manifest to recognize errors everywhere and you are error prone. Let's continue. Popper goes on to say quote

### 12m

yet the theory that truth is manifest not only breeds fanatics men possessed by the conviction that all those who do not see the manifest truth must be possessed by the devil but it may also lead though perhaps less directly than does a pessimistic epistemology to authoritarianism. This is so simply. Because truth is not manifest as a rule. The allegedly manifest truth is therefore in constant need not only of interpretation and affirmation but also of reinterpretation and reaffirmation. An authority is required to pronounce upon and lay down almost from day to day what is to be the manifest truth and it may learn to do so arbitrarily and cynically and many disappointed epistemologists will turn away from their own former optimism and erect a resplendent authoritarian theory on the basis of a pessimistic epistemology. It seems to me that the greatest epistemologist of all Plato exemplifies this tragic development end quote. And don't we inherit some of this today? This idea that there are authorities particularly in science and there is such a thing as the science that certain scientists pronounce upon and lay down almost from day to day what is to be the science and learn to do so arbitrarily and cynically.

### 13m

Certain politicians certainly relying upon particular scientists. Who can be relied upon to say the right things. What is the science? Some people saying we are the science I've heard recently. This is a sad state of affairs and it leads to this pessimistic epistemology that certain authorities in academia and in the intellectual circles certain people well credentialed in science end up saying we are the experts. We understand the evidence. We have the evidence. It's all about a particular group of people. A priesthood if you will. Suggesting the way to validate knowledge the way for everyone else to validate knowledge is to defer to their expertise not to check whether or not the claims being made contain error or not but by virtue of some highly credentialed committee of people who designate a particular thing as being let's say the science and the evidence and what is of course settled.

### 14m

Pop goes on to say in part seven now quote. Plato plays a decisive part in the prehistory of Descartes doctrine of the veracious day the doctrine that our intellectual intuition does not deceive us because God is truthful and will not deceive us or in other words the doctrine that our intellect is a source of knowledge because God is a source of knowledge this doctrine has a long history which can easily be tracked back to at least Homer and Hesiod end quote. Now we look at a passage like that or try to understand. What's going on then and many people many people will grimace or even laugh at something as juvenile or something like that seemingly juvenile.

### 15m

How could a genius like Descartes think anything like that. Well of course he is not a juvenile. He was trying to figure out what this stuff knowledge is. He was trying to figure out how we come to understand the world and he was just under the misconception that well it has to be absolutely true a misconception people still carry around today. It's just that they don't think that God is the one. The God is the one who is able to designate something as certainly true. They take the God out but they keep the certainly true part. So there's a sense in which if you were to listen to some scientists and philosophers and thinkers today that their idea of epistemology is even more naive than this. They've thought less about this question than what Descartes had. Descartes had a problem. How is it that my claims about reality can track reality. How do I know what I'm saying isn't completely in all respects false. All he could come up with amongst other things was to say well we begin with the idea that I can't doubt my own existence. Now how can I be sure of that. Well the divine exists.

### 16m

How do I know that. Well I've got a proof for the existence of the absolutely perfect God. The absolutely perfect God being perfect by definition is not going to deceive. So when you have this sensation of being absolutely certain about something you can be certain you're absolutely certain and what you're thinking is certain is absolutely true precisely because it is guaranteed to be a. Such by a certainly existing God. It's quite a rigorous idea if you think false. OK. There are problems with this but it's not as naive as some of what you hear today where they take out the God and they take about the validation criteria and just say well we're the experts who have the evidence and we know for sure the evidence is incontrovertible. The science is settled. It's the same idea settled science. OK. Absolutely certain true manifest truth or God is telling us what is the absolute truth. Pick your misconception. Pick your misconception. It's the same mistake fundamentally. The idea that there are certain cases in which human beings are in fact not fallible.

### 17m

There are certain reasons why that are deployed in in defense of this idea. But it's all wrong. It's all an error. OK. Because error is everywhere. We can find some truth some of the time. We can't say what it is. What we have are explanations which contain truth useful information that solves our problems. But also. It contains misconceptions and ultimately in the final analysis should be expected to be false. Let's continue. Papa goes on to say quite to us. The habit of referring to one sources would seem natural in a scholar or a historian. And it is perhaps a little surprising to find that this habit stems from the poets. But it does. The Greek poets refer to the sources of their knowledge. The sources are divine. They are the muses. The Greek bards Gilbert Murray observes in the rise of the Greek epic third edition 1924. Page 96 quote always oh not only what we should call their inspiration but their actual knowledge of facts to the muses. The muses are present and know all things end quote.

### 18m

Hesiod always explains that he is dependent on the muses for his knowledge. Other sources of knowledge are indeed recognized. But most often he consults the muses. So does Homer for such subjects as the catalog of the Greek army. As this quotation shows the poets were in the habit. Of claiming not only divine sources of inspiration but also divine sources of knowledge. Divine guarantors of the truth of their stories end quote. Okay so we've got God being invoked by Descartes as the divine source of knowledge. We've got the Greeks and the poets invoking divine sources in the form of the muses. What are the divine sources today? Is it the proclamations of certain committees of scientists? Individual scientists. Anyone employed by a government who wears a white coat. Are there institutes? Are there refereed journals that are sometimes treated like holy books?

### 19m

After all if it appears in a refereed journal then it must be genuine science and not contain error. It's published and peer reviewed. Checked by people's peers after all. The experts of our time. The divine guarantors of the truth. Okay so not quite. Perhaps they wouldn't call it that. Not a divine guarantor. But you can be highly confident is the way they normally say it. We're at the five sigma confidence level that this thing is true. It's not divine. It's not divinely guaranteed. But it's almost guaranteed by statistics is kind of what's implied. Let's keep going. Quote. Precisely the same two claims were raised by the philosophers Heraclitus and Parmenides. Heraclitus it seems sees himself as a prophet who talks with raving mouth. Possessed by the God. By Zeus. The source of all wisdom. And Parmenides one could almost say forms the missing link between Homer or Hesiod on the one side and Descartes on the other.

### 20m

His guiding star and inspiration is the goddess Diki described by Heraclitus as the guardian of truth. Parmenides describes her as the guardian keeper of the keys of truth and as the source of all his knowledge. But Parmenides and Descartes have more in common than the doctrine of divine veracity. For example Parmenides is told by his divine guarantor. Of truth that in order to distinguish between truth and falsehood he must rely upon the intellect alone to the exclusion of the senses of sight hearing and taste. And even the principle of his physical theory which like Descartes he founds upon his intellectualist theory of knowledge is the same as that adopted by Descartes. It is the impossibility of avoid the necessary fullness of the world. End quote. This idea of the fullness of the world is one of those quirky parables. Parts of philosophy. Leibniz goes on about a similar kind of a thing. Plato was obsessed by it of course. But what's interesting for me here is how Popper is going directly to the problems here in philosophy.

### 21m

That they keep reoccurring in different places. How is it that we validate as certain our knowledge? It's all a misdirection. It just leads to these enduring debates about the impossibility of getting to certain knowledge. And the only explanations that are martial in defense of this idea. Are things that contain obvious error when looked at carefully. And especially if you don't have a supernaturalist mindset. The problem then becomes if you've got this solution. Namely, well the supernatural guarantees that your knowledge is perfectly true. You've got a bit of a problem if you still endorse the concept of certain perfect knowledge. But you don't endorse the concept of a certainly perfect really existing god or gods or something divine. You've got a problem then. And this is the problem that people have. People have today who search for certainty. Who want the justified true belief. But they don't have anything to guarantee that. And they don't seem to care. It's just like well we'll push forward anyway.

### 22m

With insisting that our ideas are justifiably true in some way shape or form. Without worrying about the basis. Ah that philosophy stuff. That's irrelevant. We're just doing science here. Which leads us to the truth. The science. Okay so it's not always like that for all scientists. But the way in which some people. Some people who are enamored by the process. Of science without really understanding it. The way they speak. It's kind of in these terms. Popper goes on. In Plato Ion. A sharp distinction is made between divine inspiration. The divine frenzy of the poet. And the divine sources or origins of true knowledge. This topic is further developed in the Phradeus. Plato even insists as Harold Chernus pointed out to me. On the distinction between questions of origin and of truth. Plato grants the inspiration to the poets. But denies to them any divine authority for their alleged knowledge of the facts. Nevertheless the doctrine of the divine source of our knowledge. Plays a decisive part in Plato's famous theory of. Amnesis. In which some measure grants to each man.

### 23m

The possession of divine sources of knowledge. The knowledge considered in this theory. Is knowledge of the essence or nature of a thing. Rather than of a particular historical fact. According to Plato Menno. There is nothing which our immortal soul. Does not know prior to our birth. For as all natures are. Kindred and decadent. Our soul must be akin to ale natures. Accordingly it knows them all. It knows all things. On kinship and knowledge see also Fredo. Republic and laws. In being born we may forget. But we may recover our memory and our knowledge. Though only partially. Only if we see the truth again. Shall we recognize it. All knowledge is therefore. Recognition. Recalling or remembering the essence or true nature that we once knew. This theory implies that our soul is in a divine state. Of omniscience. As long as it dwells and participates in a divine world of ideas or essences or natures. Prior to being born. The birth of man is his fall from grace.

### 24m

It is his fall from a natural or divine state of knowledge. And it is thus the origin and cause of his ignorance. Here may be the seed of the idea that ignorance is sin. End quote. Okay. So all of that idea is from Plato. Plato believed in the perfect forms. And that we had access in some way to the perfect forms. Let no one who is ignorant of geometry enter here. Remember that was on the other side. Let no one who is ignorant of geometry enter here. Remember that was on Plato's academy. He thought that mathematics was one of these ways in which we can get to the divine truth. In fact, so long as you had this clear and distinct idea. Which Descartes talked about later. You were getting to the truth. You were able to perceive the truth. Would anyone think something as silly as that today? Of course they would. What is the mathematician's misconception? The mathematician's misconception. The modern incantation of this. Is the idea that mathematical intuition gives you insight into the true nature. Of reality. Of mathematical reality. What you are doing is you are perceiving the truth directly. You are perceiving the truth directly. People usually deploy if you are not familiar with mathematics. But you understand that mathematics is a thing.

### 25m

You say well it is impossible. It is simply impossible for it to be otherwise than 1 plus 1 equals 2. 1 plus 1 equals 2. It is always the trope example. It cannot possibly be false. I perceive that as absolutely true. There is no way I could ever be mistaken about that. Or labour under any misconception about that. I am perceiving the truth. So they inherit. They inherit this misconception. People who speak in this way. Inherit this idea. That there are certain ways in which your soul. Your brain. Your mind. Is able to grasp the divine. The perfectly true. And they deploy the example of 1 plus 1 equals 2. A mathematician. Certain kinds of mathematicians. Will apply this concept to all of mathematics. Never mind just the simple statements of arithmetic. But everything that they perceive. That comes to them via their so called intuition. Comes to them via this. Divine route of inspiration. Of absolute inerrant truth. Not realising that mathematical knowledge is conjectured. And it is.

### 26m

The conjecture is a computation being performed by the brain. Which itself is error prone. And you can be deceived. You can be deceived about this stuff. There is no royal road to truth. There is no perfect way of perceiving the truth. You are bound by what the laws of physics say. And the laws of physics mandate that. Error cannot be completely avoided. Error cannot be completely avoided. Error cannot be completely avoided. And so you can never be sure that you have avoided error. There can always be error. No matter where or when or what you are thinking. Or how many people are thinking about the same thing. So this is the modern version of the divine origin or source of our knowledge. The perfect kind of knowledge. Let's continue. Popper goes on to say. It is clear that there is a close link between this theory of amnesis. And the doctrine of the divine origin or source of our knowledge. At the same time. There is also. A close link between the theory of amnesis. And the doctrine of manifest truth. If even in our depraved state of forgetfulness. We see the truth. We cannot but recognize it as the truth.

### 27m

So as the result of amnesis. Truth is restored to the status of. That which is not forgotten. And not concealed. It is that which is manifest. Socrates demonstrates this. In a beautiful passage of the minnow. By helping an uneducated young slave. To recall the proof. Of a special case of the theorem of Pythagoras. Here indeed is an optimistic epistemology. And the root of Cartesianism. It seems that in the minnow. Plato was conscious of the highly optimistic character of his theory. For he describes it as a doctrine. Which makes men eager to learn. To search and to discover. Yet disappointment must have come to Plato. For in the Republic. And also in the Phradias. We find the beginnings of a pessimistic epistemology. In the famous story of the prisoners in the cave. He shows. That even if one of the prisoners should escape from the cave. And face the real world. He would have almost insuperable difficulties. In seeing and understanding it.

### 28m

To say nothing of his difficulties. In trying to make those understand. Who stayed behind. So two things there. Two things there to highlight. One is that Socrates is able to. Have a young slave. Recall. This is in scare quotes. In Popper's passage here. Recall the proof of a special case of the theorem of Pythagoras. So there are many proofs of the theorem of Pythagoras. Now does the slave recall the proof. Or is the slave able to recreate the proof. By careful questioning. The Socratic method so to speak. This is a pedagogical technique. That many teachers use. The right deployment of questions. To a learner. To someone trying to learn something. Can cause them to use. Their background knowledge. And their background knowledge might consist of. What they already understand of logic. What they already understand of reason. What they already understand of basic mathematics. In order to bring all of these. Rules and bits of knowledge together.

### 29m

To generate something new. Like a proof of Pythagoras' theorem. This is really what the slave was doing. Was using these rules. To conjecture new conclusions. And eventually reach the conclusion that. C squared equals A squared plus B squared. Something to that effect. Good mathematics teaches. Can do this as well of course. Okay. Just ask the student questions. And rather than just say. Here's the proof. You know. Ask the right questions. And the student will. Reason their way to the answer. And feel very excited. And happy about the fact. That they did it. They did the thing. They did the reasoning. They weren't just. Given the answer. This is what makes. Mathematics so rewarding. For some people. You know there's an answer. Someone has already found the answer. And you can do it yourself. On your own. By getting them. So. This is really what was going on. With the slave there of course. But. What. Socrates. And what. Plato is suggesting. Is that. In fact. You always knew it. There was a sense in which. Your. Soul. Was connected to the divine world.

### 30m

Of mathematics. And was just. Remembering what you already knew. Well not quite. Not quite. There's. There's. It's not completely and utterly false. Right. It's not completely and utterly wrong. It's just that. You can know it. It's not that you already did know it. But there's an optimism in there. That anyone can know. This is a wonderful. It's a wonderfully optimistic idea. That the young slave can do. What the learned professor can. What the learned wise philosopher can. He can. They can be equal. In this way. Of coming to learn the same thing. Though. They can both start off. Infantly ignorant. They can at least correct. The same kind of errors. And come to a mutual understanding. Of something. This is wonderful. This is optimistic. And then. Plato goes on to talk about. Well. Popper goes on to talk about. Plato's cave. And the idea that Plato thought. Well. Even if. The people trapped in. The cave. Got out of the cave. They've been trapped there. Living there. Their entire lives. They were born in the cave. They're looking at the shadows. Dancing on the cave wall. They come to think that. Reality consists of. Shadows on the wall. That if they were taken.

### 31m

Out of the cave. At some point later on. They wouldn't understand. What they saw. They wouldn't understand. Actual reality. But of course. We know. What is actual reality? Is that actual reality? That too. Is just an interpretation. Of certain stuff. But you know. Plato. Had a point. Okay. The point. Kind of there. The truth lurking. In this thought experiment. Is. In the same way. That the prisoners. Looking at the wall. Of the cave. Clearly are not seeing. Actual birds. They're just seeing. The shadows of birds. And they're not seeing. Actual trees. They're just seeing. The shadows of trees. That. Reality consists. Of something more. Than what they're perceiving there. Well. That lesson. Also applies. When you leave the cave. You're not directly perceiving. The birds. And the trees. Either. You're interpreting. Light. You're interpreting. Light. Just as the people. Trapped in the cave are. It's just that you've got. Quite a bit more of it now. Quite a bit more light. Popper goes on. Still talking about. Plato's view of epistemology.

### 32m

Popper writes. Quote. The difficulties. In the way. Of an understanding. Of the real world. Are almost. Superhuman. And only. The very few. If anybody. At all. Can attain. To the divine. State of understanding. The real world. The divine. State of. True knowledge. Of episteme. This is a pessimistic theory. With regard to. Almost all men. Though not with regard. To all. For it teaches. That truth may be attained. By a few. The elect. With regard to these. It is. One might say. More wildly optimistic. Than even the doctrine. That truth is manifest. The authoritarian. And traditionalist. Consequences. Of this pessimistic theory. Are fully elaborated. In the laws. Just an aside. Of course. I'm mentioning these things. Like the laws. They're works. By Plato. He goes on. Thus we find in Plato. The first transition. From an. Optimistic. To a pessimistic. Epistemology. Each of them forms the basis. Of one of the two. Diametrically opposed. Philosophies.

### 33m

Of the state. And of society. On the one hand. An anti-traditionalist. Anti-authoritarian. Revolutionary. And utopian. Rationalism. Of the Cartesian kind. And on the other hand. An authoritarian. Traditionalism. This development. May well be. Connected with. The fact. That the. The idea. Of an epistemological. Fall of man. Can be interpreted. Not only in the sense. Of the optimistic. Doctrine of the. Amnesis. But also. In a pessimistic sense. In this latter. Interpretation. The fall of man. Condemns all mortals. Or almost all. To ignorance. I think one can discern. In the story of the cave. And perhaps. Also in the story. Of the fall of the city. When the muses. And their divine. Teaching are neglected. See the republic. An echo. Of an interesting. Older form. Of this idea. I have in mind. Parmenides doctrine. That the opinions. Of mortals are. Delusions. And the result. Of a misguided choice. A misguided. Convention. This may stem. From xenophones. Doctrine. That all human knowledge. Is guesswork. And that his own theories.

### 34m

Are at best. Merely similar. To the truth. The idea. Of an epistemological. Fall of man. Can perhaps be found. As Karl Reinhardt. Suggested. In the words. Of the goddess. That mark. The transition. From the way. Of truth. To the way. Of delusive opinion. And pop goes on. With a. Quote. From Karl Reinhardt. Quote. But you. Also. Shall learn. How it was. That the delusive opinion. Forcing its way. Through all things. Was destined to pass. For the real. Now. Of this world. Thus arranged. To seem. Wholly like truth. I shall tell you. Then you will be. Never more. Overawed. By the notions. Of mortals. End quote. Thus. Though the fall. Affects all men. The truth. May be revealed. To the elect. By an act of grace. Even the truth. About the unreal. World of delusions. And opinions. The conventional notions. And decisions. Of mortals. The unreal. World of appearance. That was destined. To be accepted. And approved of. As real. The revelation. Received by Parmenides.

### 35m

And his conviction. That a few. May reach certainty. About both. The unchanging world. Of eternal reality. And the unreal. And changing world. Of verisimilitude. And deception. Were two of the main. Inspirations. Of Plato's philosophy. It was a theme. To which he was. Forever returning. Oscillating between. Hope. Despair. And resignation. End quote. So again. Millennia old. This idea that. A select. Few. Have access. To the truth. And that was of course. Inherited by. Religious people. Over the following centuries. You know. Monotheistic religions. And so forth. Who. Thought that. Particular people. Okay. Certainly in the Christian tradition anyway. That the Pope. For example. Was able to. Speak the truth. Speak ex cathedra. From the throne. And designate certain things. As simply the truth. Okay. If he said that. Mary the mother of God. Zoomed up the heaven. Body and soul. Which is called the. Assumption.

Then it really truly happened. Because he said it. And he couldn't make an error. So. It comes from this idea. Now why him? Well he's. You know. He's the elect. He's one of these. Privileged people. Now. Is it the case that today. We still think the same kind of thing. Well I leave it to the listener. As to whether or not. It is sometimes thought in society. That certain people have. Privileged access to the truth. And are less liable to fall into error. Than others. And by the way. I keep using this word. Amnesis. And I realize. Maybe that needs some definition. This is the. Theory. That Plato had. That we are. Remembering past lives. We're remembering our. Divine soul. And what it knows. It knows everything. It's omniscient. When we learn stuff. Or so called learn stuff. We're actually not learning. Things for the first time. We're remembering things. That our divine soul has. Because. In this world of. Immortality. Imperfect reality. We are just a. Shadow world. Of the. True reality. The world of forms. Of perfect forms. So. Amnesis is this idea. That we're. That the process of knowledge creation. Is a process of actually. Remembering the divine.

So let's go on. Popper. We're on to part eight now. And I'll finish with part eight today. He says. Quote. Yet what interests us here. Is Plato's. Optimistic epistemology. The theory of. Amnesis. In the Menno. It contains. I believe. Not only the germs. Of Descartes intellectualism. But also the germs. Of. Aristotle's. And especially of Bacon's. Theories of. Induction. For Menno's slave. Is helped. By Socrates. Judicious questions. To remember. Or recapture. The forgotten knowledge. Which his soul possessed. In its prenatal state. Of omniscience. It is I believe. This famous Socratic method. Called in the. Theotetus. The art of midwifery. To which Aristotle alluded. When he said. In his metaphysics. That Socrates was the inventor. Of the method of induction. Aristotle. And also Bacon. I wish. To. Suggest. Meant by induction. Not so much. The inferring. Of universal laws. From particular. Observed instances. As a method. By which we are guided. To the point. Whence we can intuit. Or perceive. The essence. Or true nature. Of a thing.

But this. As we have seen. Is precisely. The aim. Of Socrates. Meutic. Its aim. Is to help. Or lead us. To amnesis. And amnesis. Is the power. Of seeing. The true nature. Or essence. Of a thing. The nature. Or essence. With which we were. Acquainted before birth. Before our fall from grace. Thus. The aims. Of the two. Meutic. And induction. Are the same. Incidentally. Aristotle thought. That the result. Of an induction. The intuition. Of the essence. Was to be expressed. By a definition. Of that essence. Now let us look more closely. At the two procedures. The meutic art. Of Socrates. Consists. By the way. Okay. Aside. Meutic. Is the. The Socratic method. It's just a fancy word. For the Socratic method. So maybe. I'll take out meutic. And we'll just say. The Socratic method. The Socratic method. The Socratic method. Of Socrates. Consists. Essentially. In asking questions. Designed. To destroy prejudices. False beliefs. Which are often. Traditional. Or fashionable beliefs. False answers. Given. The spirit. Of ignorant. Cocksureness.

Socrates himself. Does not pretend. To know. His attitude. Is described. By Aristotle. In the words. Socrates. Raised questions. But gave no answers. For he confessed. That he did not know. Thus. Socrates method. Is not an art. That aims. At teaching. Any beliefs. But one that aims. At purging. Or cleansing. The soul. Of its false beliefs. Its seeming knowledge. Its prejudices. It achieves this. By teaching us. To doubt. Our own convictions. Fundamentally. The same procedure. Is part. Of Bacon's induction. End quote. And that's a wonderful way. To end it. Socrates method. Is an idea. Of error correction. Therefore. It is this. Sense in which. No one knows. As in. Has certain knowledge. In this particular case. In the Socratic sense. But rather. We know. That there is. Something to know. And by. Removing the errors. The false beliefs. The prejudices. And so on. And so forth. Then we can get. Somewhat closer. To the truth.

We can have a. Better understanding. By. Dispelling the bad ideas. Sifting. Some of what's true. From. A lot of what's false. Okay. It's not perfect. It's not going to lead. To. Certain divine knowledge. But it's going to get us. Closer. In some sense. To. To this. Actual reality. To an understanding. Or modelling. Of that actual reality. This really. This paper here. This lecture. Rather I should say. Is. The great philosopher. Teaching philosophy. Of the greats. You're having the master himself. Karl Popper. Talking to you. About. What the ancients. The ancients. That he looked up to. Said about all of this stuff. And how it influenced. The classic philosophers. This. Long tradition. This series. This generation. Of people. From. Socrates. And Plato. And Aristotle. Leading to. The great ideas. Of Bacon. And Descartes. And all of them. Of course. Contain. Misconceptions. But ultimately. Are all brought together.

In. The epistemology. Of Karl Popper. It really is. It's really. This lecture. Really is a master class. In the. Fundamentals. Of epistemology. In the history. Of epistemology. And why we are. Where we are now. Well. Until next time. Bye bye.
